' s financial well - being continues to be a moving target as the company made more adjustments to its earnings monday .\nin a securities and exchange commission filing , enron said it reduced third - quarter earnings by 3 cents per share and increased earnings for the first nine months of 2001 by 1 cent to reflect recently discovered accounting errors .\nthe company also said that its recent credit rating drop may force it to pay off a $ 690 million note by nov . 27 if it doesn ' t find collateral to guarantee the debt .\nthe revelations came in the embattled energy trader ' s 10 - q document , which companies must file every quarter with details of their earnings and balance sheet . enron delayed releasing the 10 - q by five days and said the filing made monday had not been fully audited by its accounting firm , andersen , because of an ongoing investigation by the company ' s board of directors and the need for more time .\n\" we are continuing to review the transactions in question and are making progress with our investigation , \" said william k . powers jr . , chairman of enron ' s special investigation committee and dean of the university of texas school of law .\nenron ' s pending $ 690 million iou is related to a limited partnership to buy natural gas assets in brazil . one of the terms of the partnership requires enron to repay the debt if its credit rating slips to bbb - on rating agency standard & poor ' s scale , which it did nov . 12 . if enron doesn ' t put up collateral equal to the amount of the note or repay it , the other partners in the deal can sell off the partnership ' s assets .\nenron officials said in the filing they are working with lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt .\nif enron ' s debt rating continues to drop , which would put it below investment grade , the company would face another $ 3 . 9 billion in debt repayments , the company said in the filing , mainly by two other partnerships formed in recent years : $ 2 . 4 billion owed by osprey trust and $ 915 million by marlin water trust .\nenron is under a negative review by most rating agencies , but a cash infusion from dynegy combined with additional lines of credit from a number of investment banks and a possible $ 500 million to $ 1 billion equity investment by other investors is expected to keep the ratings afloat .\nthe turmoil around enron ' s finances started after oct . 16 , when steep losses in its third -

' ' but now it sounds like enron ' s problems were actually more inherent than perceived . ' '\nenron ' s deal with dynegy calls for enron holders to receive 0 . 2685 dynegy share for each enron share , but in trading since the deal was announced enron ' s share price has lagged dynegy ' s price , reflecting investor doubts that the deal will be completed at the announced terms .\nin new york stock exchange trading yesterday , before the enron filing was released , enron rose 6 cents , to $ 9 . 06 , and dynegy rose $ 1 . 13 , to $ 43 . 60 . at those prices , the value of the dynegy offer is 29 . 2 percent above enron ' s share price , compared with a 20 . 6 percent difference when the deal was announced .\nsome debts that enron might have to pay quickly if its bond rating is lowered could be satisfied by selling shares , but such sales would probably reduce the stock price further . and the merger agreement with dynegy provides that the exchange ratio would be reduced if enron sold stock at prices below the implied value under the merger - - currently $ 11 . 71 an enron share .\nin after - hours trading yesterday , after the release of the enron filing , the share price slipped to $ 9 .\nenron had previously said it was reducing its profits taken in previous years by more than $ 500 million . yesterday ' s filing provided some additional details on enron ' s relationships with various related partnerships whose debts enron could be forced to pay , and it said that additional write - offs could come as early as the current quarter if it concluded that asset values in the partnerships had declined . it said that because enron ' s stock value had fallen , one write - down could be $ 700 million .\nthe disclosures show that enron erected complicated financial structures that in some cases seem to have been meant to allow the company to avoid taking losses on assets and in other cases were aimed at keeping debts off its balance sheet .\nbut the collapse of enron ' s stock price has both worsened the situation for some of those entities and greatly increased the cost enron would face if it needed to pay off the debts .\n' ' it is not possible to predict , ' ' enron warned investors , whether its asset sales or debt refinancings would be successful .

trading company continued its merger talks with rival dynegy inc . dynegy , an independent power producer and utility owner , is looking at acquiring enron for roughly $ 7 billion to $ 8 billion , people familiar with the talks say . however , those talks could also be influenced by whether enron is further downgraded by major credit - ratings agencies .\nthe total price being discussed would equate to about $ 10 an enron share , barely above where the stock is currently trading and far below the level of even two weeks ago . as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday , enron shares were down 7 . 1 % , or 64 cents , to $ 8 . 41 , a tenth of their 52 - week high of $ 84 . 875 .\non the big board , dynegy traded at $ 36 . 50 , up $ 3 . 50 . shares of several energy - trading companies were up yesterday following a directive from federal regulators that the california state government pay an estimated $ 1 . 6 billion for past power purchases .\nin yesterday ' s sec filing , enron also made major adjustments in its reported assets , debt and shareholder equity back to 1997 . for instance , for the three - month period ended sept . 30 , enron lopped about $ 2 . 2 billion , or 19 % , off shareholder equity , reducing it to a total of $ 9 . 5 billion . previously , the company had disclosed a reduction of only $ 1 . 2 billion .\nthe filing also said that enron discharged ben glisan , the company treasurer , and kristina mordaunt , the general counsel of enron ' s north america unit , in connection with investments they made in one of the officer - run limited partnerships . until yesterday , enron had insisted that mr . glisan wasn ' t associated with the officer - run partnerships . the company wouldn ' t explain why the the two had been discharged , and mr . glisan and ms . mordaunt couldn ' t be reached to comment .\nthe sec filing is the latest chapter in a crisis that has engulfed the nation ' s biggest energy - trading company during the past month . during that time , enron has reported a big third - quarter loss , the replacement of its chief financial officer who ran two of the controversial partnerships , and an sec investigation .\nthe sec filing raises further questions about enron ' s accounting procedures and disclosure policies . concerns over these matters are vexing investors and analysts , including those at major credit - rating agencies . the agencies downgraded enron debt during recent weeks and have the company on review for further downgrades .\nralph pellecchia , credit analyst for fitch , said he couldn ' t predict what effect the sec filing would have on enron ' s credit rating , but he added that the document contained damaging disclosures . \" it ' s bad , \" he said .\nthe enron sec filing also raises questions about the conduct of its outside auditor , arthur andersen llp , which reviewed the company ' s annual financial statements and certified them as consistent with accepted accounting principals . because of all the accounting adjustments \" the audit reports covering the year - end financial statements for 1997 - 2000 should not be relied upon , \" yesterday ' s sec filing said .\nan andersen spokesman called enron ' s restatement announcement \" an unfortunate situation \" but said the accounting firm is \" cooperating with the company . . . to bring resolution to these matters . \" he said he couldn ' t comment further because of client - confidentiality concerns .\namong the accounting turnabouts , enron said it had improperly accounted for two partnerships connected to michael\nkopper , a former managing director of the company ' s north america unit . the two partnerships were known as joint energy development investments lp , or jedi , and chewco investments lp .\nas reported , mr . kopper managed the general partner of chewco , which was formed in 1997 . jedi had been formed in 1993 by enron in partnership with the huge california public employees ' retirement system , or calpers .\nin 1997 enron , which operated jedi , bought out calpers ' interest for $ 383 million and immediately sold it to chewco , according to the sec filing . almost all the money for chewco ' s purchase came in loans from jedi and an unnamed financial institution , whose loan was guaranteed by enron .\nby having a supposed outside party in the form of chewco as a partner , enron treated jedi as an unconsolidated affiliate and kept hundreds of millions of dollars of partnership debt off its balance sheet . enron now acknowledges that treatment was wrong and that both jedi and chewco should have been consolidated starting in 1997 . taking that step retroactively resulted in a $ 396 million reduction in net income for the years 1997 to 2000 , the sec filing said .\nmr . kopper , who left enron in july to run the partnerships , didn ' t return a phone call seeking comment . in the past , he has declined to be interviewed .\nenron also retroactively consolidated some of the results of its dealings with a partnership called ljm cayman lp . that consolidation reduced 1999 and 2000 net income by $ 103 million .\nljm and a similar but much larger partnership , called ljm 2 co - investment lp , were formed in 1999 by enron ' s then - chief financial officer andrew fastow , who was replaced last month . the two partnerships were run by mr . fastow and mr . kopper , according to the enron sec filing and private partnership documents . enron ' s sec filing said the company believes that mr . fastow sold his interests in the ljm partnerships in july to mr . kopper . mr . fastow has declined to be interviewed .\nseveral analysts said they were troubled that none of the earnings restatements were directly attributed to the much larger ljm 2 partnership . some also pointed to a sentence in the sec filing that said \" it is possible \" that continuing enron reviews will \" identify additional or different information concerning these matters . \"\nas such , \" there remains doubt about whether there is something else in the closet , \" said brian youngberg , energy analyst at edward jones in st . louis .\nthe enron sec filing gave new information about the effect on company earnings of transactions related to the ljm partnerships . since 1999 , those transactions produced $ 577 . 8 million in pretax earnings , despite a $ 711 million pretax charge in this year ' s third quarter due to the termination of deals with several ljm 2 - related entities . the filing also estimated that mr . fastow received more than $ 30 million from the ljm partnerships .\n- - - mea culpa\nin the midst of talks to be acquired by dynegy , enron details\naccounting and other actions .\n- -

' '\nthat excellent advice was not issued by enron management , although it should have been . instead it came more than 30 years ago from john n . mitchell , president richard m . nixon ' s attorney general .\nenron ' s restatement of earnings yesterday did not go far enough to allow investors to understand all of what went on during the company ' s many strange transactions with related parties . it is now consolidating the results of some of its off - balance - sheet creations , though what happened in the most important ones remains a mystery .\nbut the restatement should , at the least , cause investors and wall street analysts to realize they have been fooled by so - called pro forma earnings , which leave out unpleasant realities and ignore accounting rules .\nin january , enron told investors its ' ' recurring net income , ' ' as it calls its pro forma number , would be $ 1 . 70 to $ 1 . 75 a share this year . the company ' s share price rose to $ 82 when that forecast was made .\nremarkably , enron is still on course to hit that target . yesterday ' s restatement raised its nine - month earnings figure by a penny , to $ 1 . 36 . and yet enron appears to be willing to sell out for about $ 10 a share , or less than six times its reported profits , which still appear to be growing . why so little ?\nthe answer may be that enron ' s board knows those numbers are not reliable measures of performance . enron ' s failure to disclose more about the still unconsolidated subsidiaries is an indication that the unreleased facts would not be reassuring . and enron cannot stay in business unless customers and investors believe it is financially solid . so it is willing to sell out for a fraction of what it appeared to be worth only weeks ago . don ' t call it a takeover . takeunder would be a better term .\nwhat set off enron ' s collapse ? it now appears to have been a mistake . enron says it added $ 1 billion to shareholder equity in 2000 and early this year in error . the mistake did nothing to improve enron ' s profits at the time , so it seems unlikely it was deliberate . had the mistake not been made , the reduction in shareholder equity it disclosed last month would have been $ 200 million , not $ 1 . 2 billion . that reduction scared investors into believing that enron ' s transactions with partnerships led by andrew fastow , its former chief financial officer , had been disastrous for the company . now it appears they may not have been so bad .\nbut that fact is not very important now . enron ' s new disclosures indicate that perhaps 40 percent of its reported profits in 2000 came from dealings with the fastow partnerships . such profits may be legal under accounting rules , but there are good reasons to doubt how real they are .\nin fact , the accounting rule makers are even now pondering a question that may be important to enron . the body charged with dealing with new accounting issues got a rush question on oct . 23 - - the day before enron ousted mr . fastow - - about the accounting on transactions at a hypothetical ' ' big energy corporation ' ' where one subsidiary , a natural gas pipeline company , trades with another subsidiary , an energy trading entity . the question posed was whether a company can report profits made by one subsidiary while ignoring the losses of the other one . that company may or may not be enron .\nsuch games will not work anymore , at least for enron . it needs to be acquired because its customers are not willing to believe even its revised numbers .\ngraph shows enron share prices since oct . 15 .\ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones section c\nsurest steps , not the swiftest , are propelling dynegy past enron\nby neela banerjee\n11 / 09 / 2001\nthe new york times\npage 5 , column 1\nc . 2001 new york times company\nthe tortoise appears ready to overtake the hare .\nuntil they confirmed yesterday that they were in merger talks , the enron corporation and dynegy inc . were rivals within the new , rapidly evolving deregulated power industry . each embodied a sharply different approach to making money , attracting investors and winning over regulators .\nenron thrived on risk , hurling itself into projects and businesses largely untested by others , earning along the way a reputation for innovation and the acclaim of the investors and analysts who now so angrily shun it because of its murky accounting .\ndynegy is the slower , more cautious company , the younger sibling that carefully gleaned lessons from the example set by a brasher enron . dynegy ' s steady progress has now made it strong and solvent enough to contemplate a multibillion - dollar takeover of its erstwhile competitor .\nas one senior energy industry executive said , ' ' enron ' s trying to hit more triples and home runs , while dynegy tries for singles and doubles . ' '\nkenneth lay , the enron chairman and chief executive who built an empire from two troubled gas pipeline companies - - and whose influential friends include president bush - - is the one who points to the bleachers . dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive , charles l . watson , is less well known but is well respected among stock analysts . he also started small , nurturing his energy trading and generating company - - which had $ 33 billion in revenue for the nine months ended sept . 30 - - from a natural gas trading concern he began in the mid - 80 ' s .\nwhen electricity markets around the united states were deregulated , the companies followed clearly divergent paths . utilities no longer necessarily generated power , and they and their larger industrial clients looked for good deals on the power being sold on the new wholesale markets for electricity . enron and dynegy traded and marketed energy . yet enron sold most of the power plants it owned and focused mainly on financial transactions rather than the actual physical delivery of power , a strategy that made the company a lot of money very fast .\ndynegy bought power plants instead and focused on being a reliable supplier of energy . it cashed in , too , on deregulation , but not as enron had . it stuck to its core energy business as its archrival branched into overseas operations , retail power marketing , a water business and a broadband venture , most of which have gone badly awry .\nmr . watson said in an interview earlier this year that a string of power plant acquisitions had kept his company diversified and balanced . ' ' we need a little bit everywhere , ' ' he said . ' ' enron is a financial player , but dynegy is more of a physical player . ' '\nif enron ' s finances grew more confusing , dynegy seemed to offer clarity . if enron promised a lot , analysts said , dynegy played up its accomplishments . enron lobbied regulators and politicians very publicly , while dynegy kept things quiet and discreet .\n' ' chuck watson is a pretty straight - talking guy , ' ' said christopher r . ellinghaus , a williams capital group analyst .\nbecause enron had such extravagant earnings promises to fulfill , some analysts said , it may have been tempted to hide its problems and losses with creative accounting . while dynegy avoided such a path , no one really expects mr . watson to gloat about his company ' s new , larger stature . enron may have been less a hare than a canary in the deregulation coal mine , and it is unclear who will take on that role now .\n' ' dynegy had what could be called a second - mover advantage , ' ' said andre meade , head of commerzbank securities ' united states utility research . ' ' it seemed to be content to watch its larger rival up the street in houston , enron , go into a market . and if it was successful , dynegy then could go in with less money and make it work .

' ' however , the effective industry bailout that the merger would represent would probably lead to some leniency from the f . t . c . , and would probably be looked at with some relief by the f . e . r . c . ' '\nit was clear yesterday there would be opposition to the deal . ' ' if dynegy and enron were to get together , obviously the thing that would appeal to dynegy would be to combine the trading function of the two entities , and that in itself would provide greater market power , not less market power , ' ' said raymond plank , chairman of the apache corporation , one of the largest independent natural gas producers , based in houston .\nmr . plank said he hoped regulators would take a critical look at any deal . ' ' the thing they should take a look at is the concentration of market power that has led to excessive volatility , and as a result , once again is threatening north american gas producers . ' '\nenron ' s restated profits almost wiped out its net income in 1997 , and reduced it for every year since . but the changes actually raised its reported profits so far this year by $ 5 million .\nthe changes came largely from including results of two special purpose partnerships that it had treated as being independent - - companies called jedi and chewco , after characters in the ' ' star wars ' ' movies - - and of including a subsidiary of a partnership called ljml . that partnership , and another called ljm 2 , were run by mr . fastow .\nthe remainder of the earnings reductions , totaling $ 92 million from 1997 through 2000 , came from what enron called ' ' prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications , ' ' which appear to have been changes previously recommended by arthur andersen , enron ' s auditors , but not made because the auditors were persuaded the amounts were immaterial . details of those charges were not disclosed , and enron said it might further alter its reporting as a special board committee continues its investigation of the partnership transactions .\n' ' this is an unfortunate situation , ' ' said david tabolt , a spokesman for arthur andersen , which audited enron ' s books in all the years in question . ' ' issues have surfaced that have caused the company to restate its financial statements and advise investors that they should not rely on enron ' s financial statements or our audit reports . we are cooperating with the company and its special committee to bring resolution to these matters . ' '\nwhile the restated financial statements consolidated the results of two partnerships and the ljml subsidiary , they did not fold the entire ljml partnership or the ljm 2 partnership into enron ' s financials . it is not clear how those partnerships performed . nor did they include some other related entities whose enron - guaranteed debts have aroused concern among investors .\nmr . fastow , enron ' s former chief financial officer , could not be reached for comment , his lawyer said .\nenron ' s downward cascade began after it reported third - quarter earnings on oct . 16 . its share price rose 67 cents , to $ 33 . 84 , that day , as the company said its ' ' recurring net income ' ' had met analyst expectations , even though write - offs led to a net loss .\nin a conference call that day , kenneth l . lay , enron ' s chairman , mentioned that the company had written down shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion as it closed out its relationships with the ljm partnerships . in the following days , that figure became widely discussed as some investors concluded that the company had suffered a large loss that it was able to avoid reporting on the earnings statement .\nbut enron said yesterday that reduction should have been only $ 200 million , with the remaining $ 1 billion reduction simply reversing prior errors made in 2000 and early this year .\nenron said it had set up procedures to monitor transactions with the ljm partnerships and assure they were proper . ' ' whether these controls were properly implemented ' ' is being investigated by the special board committee , the company said . that committee has retained william mclucas , a former director of enforcement for the s . e . c . , as well as accountants from deloitte kristina mordaunt , the general counsel of an enron division ; and kathy lynn , vice president of an enron division . the company said ms . lynn no longer worked for enron and that the company was ' ' terminating the employment ' ' of the other two .\nsome industry officials said yesterday that a deal with dynegy was increasingly looking like a do - or - die prospect for enron , as other energy - trading companies began to back away from the company and take their business to other trading companies . while enron has a large network of natural gas pipelines and other profitable assets , by far its most valuable franchise is its energy - trading business in north america , which acts as an intermediary in more gas and electricity trades than any other company .\nyesterday , volume in that business dropped 20 percent . an enron spokesman said company traders attributed the drop to concerns about the s . e . c . investigation and the outcome of the merger talks with dynegy .\nenron also canceled a planned meeting with its creditors today in houston , executives said . the agenda for the meeting had been an extension of its $ 3 billion credit lines , but the merger talks superseded that discussion .\nphoto : dynegy ' s chief executive , charles l . watson , is respected among stock analysts .

billion question . bearish stock markets are the indispensable scavengers of capitalism . they clean up the financial and economic landscape and kill off disease - carrying pests . true believers in free markets should rejoice when bears rush in after a prolonged period of misbehaviour has fouled the financial environment .\nthose of us who thought the energy industry would escape the great technology bear market may have been too complacent . in recent weeks , the biggest loser on the new york stock exchange has not been a tech stock , but enron , a component of the dow jones utilities index . enron ' s high was $ 89 . 06 a share , and as recently as august it was trading at $ 45 . in recent weeks , enron ' s shares have plunged , closing last week below $ 12 . 33 that collapse has sent shock waves through the capital markets . what may be even more significant for energy producers and users is the valuation of enron ' s bonds : they are trading at distressed prices , offering yields comparable to junk bonds . the ratings services have turned highly negative on enron , although they still rate it an investment - grade credit .\n( i regret - - oh how i regret ! - - that i must disclose before proceeding further that investment funds i manage have , at this writing , exposure to enron stock , acquired at prices substantially above current markets . )\nfor canadians unfamiliar with enron and its place in u . s . energy markets , here is an introduction : voltaire summed up the entire 18 th - century deistic proof of the existence of god by saying , \" if god did not exist , it would be necessary to invent him . \" it ' s the same with enron . u . s . energy markets needed a prime mover . prior to enron , these markets ( other than crude oil ) were relatively primitive and inefficient . neither producers nor consumers had means to hedge their risks effectively , and long - term contracts were made - - if at all - - under circumstances of grossly inadequate information .\nthe futures market for natural gas was spotty and unreliable , and no futures market for electricity existed . enter enron . in the past half - dozen years , enron became the greatest trading house for energy in the world . its willingness to make markets in energy futures in almost any amount transformed the markets for electric power and gave natural gas producers and consumers reliable hedging and financing opportunities , day in , day out .\nby putting its own capital on the line to make trades , enron created depth , liquidity and transparency in energy markets . so active were those markets that they gave price signals to all who would follow them . conspicuous among those who didn ' t were the policy - makers in california . had gov . gray davis and his top officials followed the developments in electricity futures , they would have realized the real nature of the risks facing consumers in the golden state . instead , they let a crisis develop , and then locked in long - term purchase contracts at all - time record - high prices just before they collapsed to normal levels .\nby some estimates , enron is on one side or the other of 25 per cent of all outstanding futures contracts in natural gas and electricity . since these contracts extend years ahead , and since the other parties to those trades are relying on enron ' s ability to cover its obligations , the risks to energy prices and supplies could be enormous if enron were to default .\nthat still seems extremely improbable . contracts executed through the public futures markets have the financial protection of those exchanges for enron ' s \" counterparties \" ( the term for the other side of a futures contract ) . but enron has enormous exposure through direct deals that have no such protection .\nwhat has hammered enron ' s securities lately is the unfolding story of gigantic off - balance - sheet deals the company made with partnerships that included , astonishingly enough , the chief financial officer , who was finally forced to go on leave . these partnership deals were never really disclosed , except in obscure balance sheet notes that gave no indication of the scale of the deals or that a senior company officer was involved .\nwhy should investors who aren ' t owners of enron stock or bonds care ? because the past year has seen the biggest swings in natural gas and electricity prices in history , and some observers wonder whether enron ' s internal problems exacerbated those swings . worse , if enron has to withdraw from the markets , what about the billions in forward hedging contracts that producers and consumers have in place ? many u . s . energy producers locked in high prices by making huge forward sales . if those contracts are voided , defaults could spread through the system , throwing energy markets into chaos .\nthere were enough problems in the energy - short u . s . even when enron was keeping the markets functioning . if the master market maker goes down , or is forced to curtail its operations , this winter could be a truly chilling experience for north americans . when bush and cheney aren ' t worrying about bin laden or anthrax , they may be worrying about enron .\ndonald coxe is chairman of harris investment management in chicago and toronto -

purpose vehicle , and for outside investors to participate they had to be compensated .\nwhat that meant was that when the value of enron ' s private equity investments fell below a certain level , people familiar with enron ' s balance sheet said , co -

cost way to head off any problem .\nand enron ' s pipelines , gas storage business , power plants , liquefied natural gas facilities , and other physical assets would be difficult to duplicate . they would sell for a significant premium to the book value on which the bondholders have first call .\nso enron ' s $ 13 bn of debt is most likely a good buy , and you are getting it at close to bankruptcy prices . it is probably a good idea to leave the bet on the takeover price of the equity to the professional risk arbs .\n( c ) copyright financial times ltd . all rights reserved .\nhttp : / / www . ft . com .\ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .\nenron in crisis -

up in the energy markets were enron to fail , although some say the volatility may be only short term . a takeover would not be the only way for rivals such as dynegy to capitalise on enron ' s weakness , however . dynegy , el paso and duke energy are already assessing potential opportunities to pick up enron ' s share of the market should it disappear . many are trading partners with enron , and some , like aquila , have been reducing their exposure as counterparties as the enron crisis deepens .\nhowever , any dynegy takeover of enron would invite close regulatory scrutiny . most analysts believe a deal could be done , but approval could take more than a year due to market issues and the complexity of the two companies .\nsome analysts said a deal might be perceived as a necessary bail - out for the trading industry , and therefore welcomed by the federal trade commission and the federal energy regulatory commission .\nothers , however , raised serious concerns about the prospect of a bid by dynegy . although dynegy had told investors it was ready to make large acquisitions or mergers in the us and overseas , they had not expected such a transforming deal . mr watson told analysts in october that he was considering deals which could add generation assets , gas pipeline and storage infrastructure , entire utilities and communication assets .\ncarol coale , an analyst at prudential securities , says there would be other concerns surrounding any deal with enron .\n\" strategically and culturally , the companies do not fit well together , \" she says , adding that enron has been moving to offload units while dynegy has preferred to hang on to assets .\ncarol levenson at gimme credit . com , an independent provider of credit research , says dynegy would be taking \" a big risk \" to its credit ratings by even being associated with enron ' s liabilities : \" dynegy is utterly dependent on its credit ratings and the confidence of the market and its trading partners to do business profitably . \"\nanalysts took some comfort , however , in the possible involvement of the newly merged chevrontexaco , which owns a 27 per cent stake in dynegy . additional reporting by andrew edgecliffe -

simmering questions about its transparency .\nanalysts had long advised investors to look past those questions . after all , with the launch of enron ' s online platform in 1999 , trading volumes had soared as the number of products traded over the internet grew to almost 2 , 000 , ranging from weather derivatives to coal . enron ' s revenue more than doubled to $ 101 bn from 1999 to 2000 .\nmany admitted they were unsure how enron made its money . not only had the company so dramatically transformed itself from a traditional pipeline company but it had moved increasingly into unsupervised areas that made it harder to scrutinise enron ' s finances .\n\" it became a new age holding company , \" says paul kedrosky , who teaches strategy and corporate governance at the university of british columbia . \" as long as the company performed , people were willing to forgive what was obviously horrific disclosure . \"\nthose people included not only share market investors but also those in the business of buying and selling energy commodities . they needed goods and enron delivered more natural gas and electricity than anyone else , often at better prices . it was the first stop for utilities who lacked sufficient generation facilities to keep the lights on for their customers .\nthey would go to the open market and purchase electricity , much of the time from enron . those that use natural gas to power their generation facilities obtained that through the open market as well . many have locked themselves into long - term contracts with enron that they cannot get out of - and they would be the ones with most to lose if enron went under .\nbut those who were originally most spooked by the prospect of business without enron - the energy traders - seem to have accepted the reality that enron will most likely never dominate the markets as it had in the past .\nanalysts and traders say the trading markets themselves have remained stable throughout enron ' s troubles even as the risk of uncertainty has increased . \" no one knows their positions or how they ' re hedged in the market , or how they might have to cover their positions , \" one energy trader said yesterday .\neven though enron had been hailed as the innovator in building these markets to their current state of sophistication , it has been forced over the past few weeks to act increasingly like a newcomer .\nhowever , analysts say some of enron ' s partners in the us and europe are demanding enron provide evidence of the availability of cash or security that can be called on quickly .\nenron ' s main competitors are now able offer better prices , and - while still not openly seeking to undermine enron - are undercutting its business as they report new customers and higher volumes . but , so far , no major counter - party has changed its terms with the company . \" out of respect for enron ' s presence , my sense is the industry has tried to give them the benefit of the doubt to see if they can resolve this situation , \" says michael zimmer , of law firm baker & mckenzie . see lex .\n( c ) copyright financial times ltd . all rights reserved .\nhttp : / / www . ft . com .\ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .\nfront page -

trading natural gas and electricity on wholesale markets .\nand while enron kept certain details about its finances secret , the company ' s stature as the crown jewel among energy traders grew .\ninvestors from wall street to main street sought a piece of the action as enron reported bigger and bigger profits and executives boasted they would successfully apply their energy trading strategies to other markets as well , including steel and broadband communications .\nhowever , after a decade in which enron firmly established itself as the nation ' s no . 1 natural gas and power marketing company , things have not gone according to plan lately and the former high - flyer has experienced a remarkably fast fall from grace .\nenron ' s stock price began a steady descent 10 months ago when its nascent high - speed internet unit failed to live up to the hype . the downward momentum was further propelled by difficulties collecting money from power customers in india .\nthen , in the past three weeks , enron ' s share price plummeted fast and furiously as the company announced a $ 618 million third quarter loss , ousted its chief financial officer and undertook an apparently fruitless scramble for cash to remain an independent entity .\nseveral news organizations were reporting that dynegy was negotiating to buy enron for $ 8 billion in stock , but that the tentative deal could still fall apart .\nbesides dynegy , companies mentioned as possible suitors included general electric ' s ge capital unit and royal dutch / shell group .\non thursday , both dynegy and enron released statements confirming they were in talks , but declined to provide any details .\nthe new york times , the wall street journal and the houston chronicle , among others , reported thursday that dynegy is considering paying about $ 8 billion in stock for enron , citing people familiar with the matter . chevrontexaco corp . , which has a 27 percent stake in dynegy , would provide enron an immediate cash infusion of $ 1 billion , the papers reported .\nenron ' s lay would not be given any formal management position in the combined company , although he would have a seat on its board , the journal reported .\nenron said it released the revised earnings so that investors could \" appropriately value the strength of our core businesses . \"\n\" we believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the sec about these matters , \" said kenneth lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive\nthe company also fired treasurer ben glisan and a lawyer , kristina mordaunt , on thursday . last month , enron ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow , who was in charge of some of the partnerships being probed by the sec .\njeff skilling , enron ' s former chief executive who left in august , has been called to testify before the sec , although it ' s unclear when .\nwall street analysts admitted they were stunned by the rapid demise of enron , but said a merger with dynegy would help improve enron ' s credibility .\nstill , prudential securities analyst carole coale remained puzzled as to \" why dynegy ' s management would want to take on the uncertainties and potential liabilities associated with a merger with enron . \"\nchristopher ellinghaus of williams capital in new york said enron ' s accounting \" shenanigans \" are legendary in the industry .\n\" i ' m not willing to say it ' s fraud yet , \" ellinghaus said . \" enron just likes to be fancy . they may have been too fancy for their own good . \"\nenron said the revised financial statements will include a reduction to net income of about $ 96 million in 1997 , $ 113 million in 1998 , $ 250 million in 1999 and $ 132 million in 2000 , increases of $ 17 million for the first quarter of 2001 and $ 5 million for the second quarter and a reduction of $ 17 million for the third quarter of 2001 .\nenron , the nation ' s top buyer and seller of natural gas and the top wholesale marketer in the united states , had become one of the nation ' s 10 largest companies , recording revenue of $ 100 . 8 billion in 2000 .\n- -

paced new economy . even after the puncturing of the market bubble , the critics who had long questioned the texas company ' s aggressive growth strategy and even more aggressive accounting were dismissed as old - fashioned cranks .\nnow , in no small part because of its executives ' own highhandedness and dismissive treatment of those same investors and analysts , enron ' s reputation is in tatters , the u . s . securities and exchange commission is probing billions of dollars worth of off - balance - sheet transactions , its once high - flying stock has tanked , its bonds are trading at levels usually reserved for troubled junk and the lawsuits are flying thick and fast .\nabout the only lessons to take away from this fiasco are among the oldest in investing and long espoused by the likes of warren buffett : never buy anything you don ' t understand and don ' t touch a company whose finances are so murky as to defy description .\nthere ' s no shortage of major companies that appear to believe the less investors know about their true financial state , the better . the dot - bomb rubble is littered with them . they include nortel networks , cisco systems , lucent technologies , amazon . com , jds uniphase , qwest communications , motorola , volkswagen and even starbucks .\nin these bearish times , most companies acknowledge , albeit reluctantly , that they would be better off coming clean with the people who have a vested interest in their future .\nhere is what joe nacchio , defiant boss of troubled qwest , told a conference last month : \" you all think we cheat and lie and steal , obviously , and therefore you trade us at a discount to what a normal company with great revenue and great growth should be traded . . . . we ' ll just let the numbers speak for themselves on oct . 31 . \"\nso along comes that fateful day , and we pass the mike over to mr . nacchio : \" some of you will recall that at a recent conference i said the results will speak for themselves . the reality is they do not speak clearly for themselves without some interpretation , given the current economic conditions and the effects of merger and other one - time charges . \" you can guess what happened to qwest ' s credibility and its stock price .\nas for houston - based enron , which is in a desperate hunt for liquidity to shore up its vast energy - trading business and keep its credit rating from being slashed below investment grade , the company confirmed yesterday it ' s in talks with smaller cross - town rival dynegy . several published accounts have said the talks involve an immediate cash infusion of up to $ 2 - billion and an eventual merger .\nfaced with the sec probe and a rash of shareholder lawsuits , enron also revealed that its profit statements since 1997 aren ' t worth anything . the company is restating earnings through the first half of this year , mainly to reflect a $ 1 . 2 - billion ( u . s . ) drop in shareholder equity after the company terminated complex share transactions with certain limited partnerships . the dealings had enabled enron to grow dramatically without having to show a huge whack of debt on its balance sheet , which would have affected its ability to raise capital and hampered its rapid transformation from regional gas pipeline utility to global energy - trading powerhouse .\nsuch transactions are common and practical . but enron ' s were unusually complicated , and the company was roundly assailed for keeping the details to itself .\ndisclosure has never been this company ' s middle name . the former ceo once used a seven - letter expletive to describe an analyst who had the temerity to ask for a balance sheet during an earnings conference call . but the real stunner was that , unknown to the investing public but with the board ' s apparent approval , two partnerships had been set up , to considerable personal profit , by enron ' s own chief financial officer , andrew faston . he walked the plank on oct . 24 , and the company has been scrambling ever since .\nopaque accounting doesn ' t necessarily mean there is any skullduggery afoot . the finances of some companies are devilishly complicated , simply because of the nature of their businesses . and that goes for enron and its massive energy - trading and hedging operations .\nbut investors should always be looking for as much financial visibility as possible and steering clear of any company that cannot - - or will not - - provide it . bmilner @ globeandmail . ca\ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .\ncity -

regardless , this should be a very competitive title match .\nskulu and predator clash in a battle of upw  s big men !\nwhile nate and richards will most likely put on a clinic when it comes to high - flying and scientific wrestling , don  t expect too much in the way of finesse as two of upw  s biggest and most popular superstars lock horns in this  colossal jostle  ! both men have gleaming win / loss records in upw . as a result , it is very difficult to pick a favorite in this one . both have become international stars in japan . predator is in the best condition of his life as he has been training for mixed martial arts competition as part of valor fighting . if the match goes past the five - minute mark , predator may have the advantage due to conditioning . countering that is the fact that skulu will have no less than 30 family members and friends on hand to cheer him on . will this be enough to inspire the powerful polynesian to pick up a very rare victory over predator ? make sure you are on hand to find out !\njapan  s sumie sakai makes upw debut @ meltdown !\nas a special added bonus attraction , one of the most respected and impressive female performers from japan , sumie sakai will make her upw debut at the galaxy . this is another example of how upw is working to showcase the skills of many of the world  s greatest grapplers for its dedicated southern california fans . over the years upw has brought in the likes of ohtani , tanaka , hoshikowa , konnan , psicosis , juventud guerrera , the late great shinya hashimoto , and many more . no word yet on who sakai will battle in her debut match .\nall\ntickets only $ 15\ntickets\non sale now :\nthe galaxy box office ( 714 - 957 - 0600 ) , ticketmaster outlets and\nticketmaster . com\nfeaturing\nappearances by\nfeaturing\nin in ring action :\nthe masterpiece\nchris masters\nfrankie\nkazarian\nsakoda\nhardkore\nkidd\njesus aguilera\nupw\nheavyweight champion\ntom howard\n- vs -\nluther\nhorshu reigns\nskulu\n- vs -\nthe\npredator\nold\nschool\noliver\njohn\n- vs -\njoey\nryan\nupw\nlightweight champion\nlil ' nate\n- vs -\ndavie richards\nscott\nlost\n- vs -\nantonio mestre\nupw\ntag team champions\nthe ballard brothers\n- vs -\nthe southside g ' s\ntriple\nthreat tag team match\ntommy wilson\nshawn riddik\nthe good guys\nlionheart\nthe human tornado\nalso\nfeaturing in in - ring action :\nma ' koa\nandrew hellman\ncard\nsubject to change\nfeaturing\na live musical performance by :\ntijuana\nbullfight ' s official website\nlisten\nto a sample of\ntijuana bullfight :\nstream\nlo - fi mp 3\nstream\nhi - fi mp 3\nmp 3\nstreams courtesy of cdbaby . com\nwednesday , july 20 th , 2005\n8 : 00 pm\nall\ntickets only $ 15\ntickets\non sale now :\nthe galaxy box office ( 714 - 957 - 0600 ) , ticketmaster\noutlets and ticketmaster . com\nto\nbe removed from the upw mailing list , please send a blank email with\nremove in the subject field to news @ upw . com"

born . they are young , mostly under 35 , and dressed in the aggressively casual uniform of the tech industry - the guys wear khakis , polo shirts , and banana republic button - downs . almost preposterously fit , they move through the building intently , like winners . enron is nothing if not energetic : a big brother - size tv screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of elevators , while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets people entering from the garage . a sculpture of the corporate symbol , an e tipped at a jaunty angle , radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axis ; a starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffeinated . multicolored , inspirational flags hang from the ceiling , congratulating enron on its diversity and its values ; one more giant banner between elevator banks declares enron ' s simple if grandiose goal : \" from the world ' s leading energy company to . . . the world ' s leading company ! \"\nfor a while , that future seemed guaranteed , as enron transformed itself from a stodgy , troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000 . it was a wall street darling , with a stock price that increased 1 , 700 percent in that sixteen - year period , with revenues that increased from $ 40 billion to $ 100 billion . \" the very mention of the company in energy circles throughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy , \" notes a 2001 report from global change associates , a firm that provides market intelligence to the energy business .\nthis enron was largely the creation of jeff skilling , a visionary determined to transform american business . hired sixteen years ago as a consultant by then - ceo ken lay , skilling helped build a company that disdained the old formula of finding energy in the ground , hauling it in pipelines , and then selling it to refineries and other customers . instead , it evolved into a company that could trade and market energy in all its forms , from natural gas to electricity , from wind to water . if you had a risky drilling venture , enron would fund it for a piece of the action . if you wanted your megacorporation ' s energy needs analyzed and streamlined , enron could do the job . if you were a third world country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning power needs , enron was there to build and build . basically , if an idea was new and potentially - and fantastically - lucrative , enron wanted the first crack . and with each success , enron became ever more certain of its destiny . the company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high - tech world , and in february of this year , skilling reaped his reward when he succeeded lay as chief executive officer . enron , says skilling , \" was a great marriage of the risk - taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk - taking mentality of the financial markets . \"\nthe enron story reflects the culture that drove american business at the end of the twentieth century . like the high - tech companies it emulated , enron was going to reinvent the american business model and , in turn , the american economy . maybe it was natural that this brave new world also produced a culture that was based on absolutes : not just the old versus the new , but the best versus the mediocre , the risk takers versus the complacent - those who could see the future versus those who could not . the key was investing in the right kind of intellectual capital . with the best and the brightest , a company couldn ' t possibly go wrong .\nor could it ? today enron ' s stock trades at around $ 35 , down from a high of $ 80 in january . the press cast enron as the archvillain of california ' s energy crisis last spring , and skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for his relentless defense of the free market . a long - troubled power plant project in india threatened the company ' s global ambitions . telecommunications , in which enron was heavily invested , imploded . wall street analysts who once touted the company questioned its accounting practices . some of the change in enron ' s fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncertain times that has afflicted all of american business . but the culture that the company created and lived by cannot escape blame .\nenron , jeff skilling says , had \" a totally different way of thinking about business - we got it . \" at enron , in fact , you either \" got it \" or you were gone - it was as simple as black and white . it is not coincidental , then , that the color scheme of skilling ' s river oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he once headed . here , the living room ' s white walls shimmer against the mahogany floors . black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets . billowy sofas set off the jet - black baby grand . in the entry , white orchids cascade from a black vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold , white marble . there is only one off - color note : after almost twenty years , jeff skilling is no longer associated with enron , having resigned abruptly after just six months as ceo . once , skilling was hailed as the next jack welch ( general electric ' s masterful ceo ) , as one of worth magazine ' s best ceo ' s in america ( anointed in 2001 ) , and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unchained adventure junkets in which , a friend told businessweek , \" someone could actually get killed . \" today , he sounds more like ebenezer scrooge on christmas morning . \" i had no idea what i ' d let go of , \" skilling says of all the personal sacrifices he made while retooling enron .\nfrom a black chair in the white library , across from a huge black and white photograph of his daughter and two sons , skilling clarifies . the demands of working 24 - 7 for enron caused him to ignore his personal finances . divorced , he lived in a 2 , 200 - square - foot house without a microwave or a dishwasher . he almost missed his brother ' s wedding . \" learning a foreign language - i never learned a foreign language ! \" he exclaims . he never once took his youngest son to school . \" i ' m interested in the kids . you don ' t do kids in fifteen - minute scheduling . \" travel : \" you can ' t go to africa for a week and get anything out of it ! \" skilling includes the study of architecture and design on his list of missed opportunities , then he stops and sighs . \" i ' m not sure that fulfillment in life is compatible with a ceo ' s job , \" he says , finally . then his eyes lock on mine , and his voice , which had softened , regains its pragmatic edge . \" it would have been easy to stay , \" he says . \" but that would not have been good for me . \"\nhe ' s a smallish , ruddy - faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight , handsome in the way of corporate titans , with piercing cheekbones and that assiduously stolid gaze . but the impatience skilling once reserved for cautious underlings and dull - witted utility company executives is now targeted at reporters who have labeled his resignation \" bizarre \" and associates who are bitterly skeptical of his need for family time . his shrug stretches the limits of his shimmering blue button - down , and his matching blue eyes look put upon . \" i ' m surprised , \" he says , \" that people have so much trouble understanding this . \"\npeople who passed through downtown houston in the late eighties or early nineties couldn ' t help but notice a funny and , for its time , novel scene unfolding throughout the workday at the base of the enron building . from nine to five and before and after , you could see people slipping out of the pristine silver skyscraper to smoke . they perched on the chrome banisters or lurked near the glass doors at the entry , puffing like mad . they always looked hurried and furtive , even ashamed . whatever people knew about enron in those days ( and most people didn ' t know much ) , it was often associated with that scene : enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters in houston , and there couldn ' t have been clearer evidence of its break with the energy world of the past . what macho engineer would have put up with such humiliation ?\nbut this company was a child of another time , that period in the mid - eighties when chaos enveloped the gas business . federal deregulation of natural gas turned a steady , secure industry , in which gas pipeline companies frequently enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served , into a volatile free - for - all . the situation was compounded five years later by federal deregulation of the pipeline business . so it happened that a gentlemanly gas pipeline company , houston natural gas ( hng ) found itself under attack from coastal corporation , oscar wyatt ' s less than gentlemanly firm . hng was then run by lay , a sturdy , taciturn former economics professor and transco chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy . ( his doctoral thesis at the university of houston was on supply and demand in the vietnam war . ) lay , who was from missouri and never succumbed - at least outwardly - to texas brashness , had done well enough : thanks to canny expansions , hng ' s pipelines stretched from florida to california and throughout the state of texas .\nhng fended off coastal , but to protect the company from other takeover attempts , lay nimbly engineered the sale of hng in 1985 to a friendly nebraska pipeline concern called internorth , one of the largest pipeline companies in the country at the time . then , a funny thing happened : hng started acting in a way that would characterize the company for years to come - a lot like coastal . what the nebraskans blithely labeled \" the purchase \" was being called \" the merger \" back in houston , and before long , following some particularly brutal politicking between omaha and houston , the company ' s center of gravity started shifting toward texas , and shortly after that , ken lay was running a new company called enron . \" over time it became clear that lay had a better vision of the future , \" says one person associated with enron at that time . \" he never fought change . he embraced change . \"\nlay had won , but what exactly did that mean ? enron was saddled with massive debt from the takeover attempt , and thanks to deregulation , no longer had exclusive use of its pipelines . without new ideas - for that matter , a whole new business plan - the company could be finished before it really even got started .\nlike many people who teamed up with enron in the eighties , jeff skilling had spent a lot of time in the midwest , and he was self - made - at fourteen he had been the chief production director at a start - up tv station in aurora , illinois . ( his mother would drop him off there every day after school . ) \" i liked being successful when i was working , and i was smart , \" he told businessweek earlier this year . but unlike many of his enron colleagues , skilling wasn ' t deliberate and soft - spoken and happy to go home at five o ' clock ; he was anxious and excitable , and nothing , but nothing excited him more than what he would come to call \" intellectual capital . \" he loved being smart , and he loved being surrounded by smart people . he graduated from southern methodist university , went into banking - assets and liability management - and took on harvard business school , where he graduated in the top 5 percent of his class . then skilling took the next step on what was then the new , souped - up path to american success : he joined manhattan ' s mckinsey and company as a business consultant , and that is where ken lay found him in 1985 .\nit is often said of lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless , and his choice of skilling probably saved the company . skilling was above all an expert at markets and how they worked . while everyone else was worrying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry , he alone saw the parallels between gas and other businesses . and so in a world where credit was nearly impossible to come by , skilling came up with what he called the gas bank , which contractually guaranteed both the supply and the price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers . enron would not be a broker but a banker . it would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the risk involved . and enron would make money on transactions , much like an investment bank would .\nskilling worked up some numbers and found them \" absolutely compelling . \" then the mckinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 enron executives . he had a one - page presentation . \" almost to a person , \" skilling says , \" they thought it was stupid . \" almost . after skilling left the meeting dejected , he walked ken lay to an elevator and apologized . lay listened and then said , \" let ' s go . \"\nthe gas bank was not an overnight success . for months skilling woke up in a cold sweat , sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of dozens of colleagues who had assisted him . in fact , he had come upon one of those divides that seem to define his life : \" i believed this whole world would be different , a huge breakthrough \" is the way skilling puts it today , and even if he is typically immodest , he was right . fairly soon after launching , the company sold $ 800 million worth of gas in a week . true to skilling ' s character , success turned out to be a matter of old versus new : he says the joke around enron was that if a company ' s ceo was under fifty , \" we were in . \" and he was in too : in 1990 skilling finally left mckinsey and joined enron as the head of enron finance corporation , a new division created just for him . in 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $ 11 million in profit . after that , says skilling , \" we never looked back . \"\nskilling and lay also realized that the gas bank couldn ' t work unless it had a trading component . myriad trades were needed to build the market that would make the project go . but by buying and selling enormous quantities of gas , enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to dominate it . the company had the best contacts , the best intelligence , and the best access to supplies . that , in turn , attracted more customers who wanted to be part of the play . with so many customers in its pocket , enron could better predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to make trades for its own benefit - enron could in effect bet on which way the price of gas would go , as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans , but with startling accuracy , thereby generating profits higher than anyone could have ever imagined .\nthis change could never have occurred without another change skilling had made : he created , within enron , a new culture to match its new trading business . the idea was to build a \" knowledge - based business , \" which demanded a skill set not exactly prized by enron ' s employees from the old hng days . most were deliberate , cautious , responsible , somewhat defensive people , most of them men , of course - the kind of people you ' d expect to find working in an industry regulated by the federal government . but now the company needed bolder people for its bold new era : that included anyone who wanted to make money - lots of money - for themselves and for the company . \" enron was going to create a niche for itself or die , \" one former executive explains . \" the people who had narrow views eventually were forced out , because if they had narrow views about other things , they had narrow views about the market . \"\nskilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people . he wanted the smartest people from schools like harvard , stanford , and maybe , rice . and because his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company , he wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the biggest and best investment banks , like merrill lynch or credit suisse first boston . in addition to being smart , enron people were also supposed to be \" aggressive . \" you were right for enron if you didn ' t want to wait until you were thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization .\nyou could see what he was looking for on \" super saturdays \" at the houston headquarters : eight fifty - minute interviews with ten minute breaks in between - the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one day . they were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts , their problem - solving ability , their passion for hard work , and what at enron was called \" a sense of urgency . \" people who scored less than 2 . 5 were scratched . the shrewdest candidates knew how to work enron before they were even hired : these were the types that automatically turned down the company ' s first offer , knowing enron would come back with more . the starting salary was around $ 80 , 000 . maybe it wasn ' t a fortune - yet - but the signing bonus , about $ 20 , 000 , was more than enough for a lease on the obligatory porsche boxster or one of the lofts being renovated close to downtown . ( enron people didn ' t live in far - flung suburbs . suburbs were uncool and too far from the office . )\nfor the lucky winners , enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted - and - talented program . new associates learned the latest techniques for structuring energy deals , and there were rotations at enron offices around the globe . the hours were long , but every possible need was taken care of . a company concierge handled all the things important people couldn ' t be bothered with : picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions , shining shoes , cleaning the house , planning a vacation . of course , a lot of people who worked for enron never got to take vacations - they were too busy making money - but they could use the company gym and the company ' s personal trainers . if they were overweight or wanted to quit smoking , they could join enron ' s wellness program . massages were offered six days a week , from seven in the morning until ten at night . \" they were so cutting edge , \" rhapsodizes someone involved with the company health care program at the time . \" they really thought about the psychology and what it took to keep these people going . \"\nskilling handed out titles analogous to those at wall street firms - analysts , associates , directors , and managing directors - but everyone knew that those titles didn ' t really matter . money did . instead of competitive salaries and decent bonuses , enron offered competitive salaries and merit - based bonuses - with no cap . \" if you really worked hard and delivered results , you could make a lot of money , \" says ken rice , who stayed with enron for 21 years until resigning recently as the head of the company ' s faltering broadband division . or , as the saying goes , you got to eat what you killed . gas traders with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $ 1 million bonus . and the more you produced , the closer you got to jeff : real hot dogs joined him glacier hiking in patagonia , land cruiser racing in australia , or off - road motorcycling in a re - creation of the baja 1 , 000 race , ending at a spectacular mexican villa . \" every time he ' d speak , i ' d believe everything he ' d say , \" one loyalist says .\nand why not ? by 1995 enron had become north america ' s largest natural - gas merchant , controlling 20 percent of the market . but at a company where the buzzword was \" aggressive , \" that was no place to stop : skilling and lay believed the gas bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business . firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better service at lower prices for consumers ( and untold profits for enron ) , they began barnstorming the country , pressing their case with entrenched power company presidents ( who , with their multimillion - dollar salaries and monopoly service areas , had little incentive to change ) and energy regulators ( who were somewhat more receptive , thanks in part to enron ' s generous lobbying efforts ) .\nbut the biggest winner of all was probably jeff skilling . in 1997 ken lay made him the president and chief operating officer of the company . by then , the division known as enron capital and trade resources was the nations largest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity . the division had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees , and revenues from $ 2 billion to $ 7 billion . \" mr . skilling ' s experience so far with the turmoil in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track , \" the new york times noted . everyone would certainly have thought so : enron and skilling had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to transforming another .\n\" firing up an idea machine ; enron is encouraging the entrepreneurs within , \" sang the new york times in 1999 . \" in the staid world of regulated utilities and energy companies , enron corp is that gate - crashing elvis , \" crowed fortune in 2000 . wall street was demanding tech - size growth on a tech timetable , and enron , in 2000 , obliged with second quarter earnings of $ 289 million , up 30 percent from the previous year . that year the company seemed to discover a market a minute : under skilling , enron was trading coal , paper , steel , and even weather . no one blinked when a london wine bar became an enron client . people drank more in warm weather than cold , so why not buy a hedge against the usual winter downturn ?\nbut most exciting to the financial world was enron ' s entry into high - tech communications . because of the company ' s marketing dominance , enrononline became another overnight success , handling $ 335 billion in commodity trades online in 2000 . enron , as usual , made its money on the spread between the bid price and the asking price . then there was the broadband business : to enron , trading excess capacity in large , high - speed fiber - optic networks ( empty lanes on the fabled information highway ) wasn ' t that different from trading the capacity of natural gas pipelines . so enron created a market for what the industry calls bandwidth . soon after , it also announced a twenty - year deal with blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people in their homes . enron looked like a company that couldn ' t lose . \" its strategy of building businesses , shedding hard assets , and trading various commodities can help it do well even in an uncertain market , \" businessweek insisted .\nthere was , however , another reason enron did so well in such a short time : the company ' s hard - nosed approach toward its customers . the old notion of customer service was based on the long haul - you had to nurse and coddle customers to keep them . but enron had new markets and new ideas - customers had to come to it . over time , the company stopping referring to its business clients as customers and began calling them \" counterparties . \"\nskilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable : gains were maximized by creating , owning , and then abandoning a market before it became overtaxed and overregulated . so if you wanted to launch a high - risk venture quickly - such as zilkha energy ' s new high - tech approach to drilling for oil - you got your financing from enron because a bank would take forever to underwrite the project , if it ever would . but because enron invented its markets and subsequently dominated them , enron could set the terms of its deals , from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happened at all .\nwhile many businesses used what was known in the industry as \" mark - to - market accounting , \" for instance , enron used it on an unprecedented scale . the company priced their deals at current market value - but it was always enron ' s idea of the market value ; companies that balked at their pricing didn ' t get deals . and while old - fashioned companies spread their profits out like annuities over a period of years , enron took most of its profit up - front . however many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years , they went on the books in the current year . if a few analysts thought there might be something fishy about what they called \" subjective accounting , \" investors didn ' t particularly care as long as the profits rolled in . as the market fluctuated and the landscape changed , the company might abandon a project that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren ' t going to be high enough . \" enron is known for leaving people at the altar , \" says one former employee . winning the highest possible profits for the company could even extend to enron ' s attitude toward charity . when a fundraiser for the houston read commission , a literacy group , called on enron for a contribution , it was suggested that he start raising money for enron ' s competing literacy charity : \" even the person who was supposed to give money away for enron was supposed to make money for enron , \" he says .\nas enron became more and more successful , the culture skilling had created took on a dark side : the competition turned inward . as one member of the enron family put it , \" it became a company full of mercenaries . \" the change started at the bottom . as enron ' s domination of the energy market grew , most of the recruiting frills fell away . new associates were treated much like the commodities the company traded . global change ' s enron spies reported overhearing orders like \" i need a smart person - go buy me one \" or \" buy me an intelligent slave , quick . \" enron had never been the kind of place where people sang to you on your birthday , but now the workaholism bordered on self - parody : a random acts of kindness program lasted only a few months . it was too disruptive . people couldn ' t get their work done .\nand , of course , enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension . the performance review committee , which had initially been installed by skilling in the capital group , became known as the harshest forced ranking system in the country . employees were rated on a scale of one to five , and those with fives were usually gone within six months . ( the prc ' s nickname quickly became \" rank and yank . \" ) it was a point of pride that skilling ' s division replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year . as one skilling associate put it , \" jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery store . \" skilling ' s approach to business - get in and get out - had become enron ' s attitude toward its workers . in time , it would become many workers ' attitude toward the company . teamwork , never that valuable in a trading culture , went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus . if protocol required an enron higher - up to come from europe to help with a project in the third world , he might help - or he might not , depending on whether another , potentially more lucrative project was pending elsewhere .\neveryone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed : \" they were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost sight of the future , \" says one former employee . anyone who couldn ' t close deals within a quarter was punished with bad prc scores , as were the higher - ups who had backed them . past errors and old grudges were dredged up so often as new ammunition in prc meetings that the phrase \" no old tapes \" became an enron clich ? . \" people went from being geniuses to idiots overnight , \" says one former enron executive .\nin such a hothouse , paranoia flowered . new contracts contained highly restrictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company . e - mail was monitored . a former executive routinely carried two laptops , one for the company and one for himself . people may have been rich at enron , but they weren ' t necessarily happy . one recruiter described the culture this way : \" they roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while you bleed to death . \"\nbefore jeff skilling could transform enron from the world ' s leading energy company into the world ' s leading company , he had to make one more change : just as he had done ten years before , skilling had to purge the company of its remaining old order . where enron once prized cautious executives who dealt with tangible assets like pipelines , it now valued bold executives who dealt with intangible assets . pipelines , power plants - they may have been enron ' s pride , but skilling wanted them gone . expensive , long - term building projects had no place when wall street was devoted to quick profits and enormous returns on investment capital , and skilling knew it . \" it wasn ' t the time for long - term approaches , \" an enron executive says of wall street ' s mood . \" it was the technology era . \"\nto rid enron of the last vestiges of its past , skilling had to take on rebecca mark , long considered his rival for the ceo ' s job . mark was for many years the poster child for the enron way : young , attractive , aggressive - her nickname was mark the shark - she came from sturdy midwestern stock but had the requisite harvard mba . mark was largely responsible for the success of enron international , the asset - heavy side of the company where she developed $ 20 billion worth of gas and power plants , which accounted for 40 percent of enron ' s profits in 1998 . for this she reaped breathtaking compensation - one enron executive estimated $ 10 million - and adoring press clips , including two appearances on fortune ' s list of the fifty most powerful women in corporate america .\nbut then mark ran into trouble with a gas - fired power plant in dabhol , india , one of the largest ever constructed . she had played the game the enron way : taking enron into a new market , she had finagled low import taxes ( 20 percent instead of the usual 53 ) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three changes in government . but the time and expense needed to make india and other enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with enron ' s goals , and skilling ' s impatience with mark grew .\nforcing mark out , however , was no easy matter . key executives left , divisions were dismantled , but she remained . the truth was enron didn ' t mind firing lower - level employees , but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive , relentless people it tended to promote . the company preferred humiliation - keeping a director in his cubicle , say , but failing to include him in the glamour deals , or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title . ( one particularly difficult executive won a few years at graduate school , gratis . ) a company as smart as enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public - relations disaster . so lay and skilling did something classically enronian : they gave mark her own company . despite skilling ' s contempt for asset - heavy businesses , enron spent more than $ 2 billion to buy a run - of - the - mill british water utility that could serve as enron ' s entry into the emerging world of water privatization . mark was put in charge of making enron , yes , the world ' s greatest water company . azurix , as the new business was called , looked like another sure thing : its ipo in 1999 raised $ 695 million .\nbut mark had to succeed on enron ' s increasingly abbreviated timetable in a business fraught with political and emotional complexities . water is not like gas or electricity - owners and governments are a lot less willing to give it up , even for lots of money . the company stumbled , layoffs commenced , and confidence evaporated . by august 2000 the stock price , which had started out at $ 19 , had fallen to $ 5 . mark ' s resignation followed , and azurix , much diminished , was folded into enron . \" i think it ' s best for rebecca to start afresh , \" lay , who had been a mentor to mark , told the wall street journal . or as one critic put it , \" they were more interested in destroying the old culture than running a business . \"\nas 2000 drew to a close , skilling was in total command . in december ken lay announced the inevitable : \" the best time for the succession to occur is when the company is doing well , \" he told the press . \" enron is doing extremely well now . \" in february 2001 jeff skilling took over the ceo ' s job .\nalmost immediately the trouble started . enron ' s domination of the electric - power market made it an instant target in the california deregulation debacle . both pbs ' s frontline and the new york times took on enron , portraying the company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in washington ( lay and enron ' s political action committee are the top contributors to george w . bush ) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying food or electricity . skilling and lay appeared on camera singing belligerent anthems to the free market , while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of the company ' s jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in california , as both tried to buy power online . the times reported that lay had tried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy deregulation . the bad press was , to say the least , ironic : just as the media was pounding enron for its omnipotence , wall street was discovering its weaknesses . by late march the stock price had slid to $ 50 a share from $ 80 in january .\nwithin enron , the asset - based divisions took the rap for the decline . ( the india plant continued to be enormously costly , at least in part because of constant turnover within enron ' s management team . ) but the california situation was more visible and therefore more damaging , despite enron ' s claim that the state had never built enough power plants to service its population and never properly managed those it had . \" for three months gray davis did a very good job of blaming us , \" says mark palmer , a vice president for corporate communications . \" we were a texas company . there was a texan in the white house . california was a state that didn ' t put him in office , and his biggest contributor was a texas energy company . performance is going to take care of our stock price . the truth will take care of gray davis . \" ( california utilities still owe enron $ 500 million , another reason stockholders might be panicky . ) but more problematic than the crisis itself was skilling ' s all too apparent lack of contrition . facing down his critics , he cracked a joke comparing california with the titanic . ( \" at least the titanic went down with its lights on . \" )\nbut the biggest problem was enron ' s telecommunications division , which had been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price . investors believed that enron could revolutionize high - speed communications , just as it had revolutionized gas and power . enron estimated the global market for buying and selling space over fiber - optic cable would grow from $ 155 billion in 2001 to $ 383 billion by 2004 - but then the tech bubble burst . so too did the much - hyped movies - on - demand deal with blockbuster . for the first time in its confoundingly successful life , enron had nothing new to take to market . like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds , enron suddenly looked less alluring to wall street .\nskilling launched a campaign to keep enron ' s most important cheerleaders , the stock analysts , in the tent , but he wasn ' t cut out to be a supplicant . during the reporting of first quarter profits , he called an analyst who challenged enron ' s financial reporting an \" asshole . \" when the company reported hefty second quarter profits , many analysts questioned whether those profits had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old assets . ignoring the growing chorus critical of enron ' s accounting , skilling promised , as he always had , that innovations were just around the corner . \" there wasn ' t any positive news , \" carol coale , of prudential financial , says now . \" basically , he talked me out of a downgrade . \"\nthe business press , so generous in the past , turned surly . fortune had asked in march whether enron was overpriced . ( \" start with a pretty straightforward question : how exactly does enron make its money ? \" ) the routine cashing in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portrayed in the media as a fire sale . ( skilling had sold $ 33 million worth , ken lay and ken rice close to four times that amount . ) then the wall street journal reported on a fund run by the cfo that had been a source of strife within the company . ( it was essentially risk management against enron ' s possible failures . ) every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in the stock price : by late august it had fallen below $ 40 . enron , so institutionally unforgiving , finally got a taste of its own medicine . \" when wall street is in love with a stock , they ' re forgiving of something like accounting , \" says carol coale . \" when a company falls out of favor , all these issues carry more weight . \"\nthis fact was not lost on people inside the company , who suddenly started experiencing an attack of conscience . those who had looked the other way as the most powerful enron executives dumped their wives and married their secretaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of their ways . \" it just created an attitude , \" one executive still at enron says . \" if senior people are doing that , why are we held to a higher standard ? there was a real culture of ' we ' re above everyone else . ' \"\nloyalty had never been prized at enron , so there was no reason to expect it now . an old - fashioned , slow - moving company like exxon could demand hardship duty in baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road . \" but , \" as one houston oilman explains , \" if you have to negotiate a hardship duty with someone who doesn ' t have loyalty and has money , then you have a corporation that ' s better suited for good times than bad . \"\nas it turned out , that description applied to jeff skilling too . as the stock price stubbornly refused to ascend , he made no secret of his unhappiness and frustration . then , after a trip to visit the families of three employees killed at a plant in england , he had an epiphany : life was short ; for him , enron was over . ever stoic , ken lay returned to the ceo ' s office , named a new president , arranged a trip to new york to calm analysts and investors , and promised a kinder , gentler enron in the future . trading anything and everything was out . the company , lay says , will still innovate but \" innovate much closer to our core . \" as for the culture : \" things like the performance review committee , i think we could have applied better . by trying to categorize people into so many different categories , you ended up creating a morale problem . \"\nthat skilling ' s supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to their lack of emotional intelligence . despite skilling ' s lengthy tenure with enron , he ' d always been contemptuous of the long haul ; he ' d always believed in cutting losses and moving on . but now that he was abandoning them when the company was in trouble , it was different . \" even jeff ' s biggest detractors wouldn ' t have wanted him to walk out the door , \" one loyalist admits .\nbut on the day we meet , skilling is looking forward , not back . \" look , \" he says with finality , \" ninety percent of my net worth is in enron . were my interests aligned with the shareholders ? absolutely . \"\nfree of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures , he is nestling himself back into the world of ideas . his eyes flash as he talks about new technologies . \" the first wave never gets it right , \" he says . \" the stand - alone dot - coms didn ' t work , but the technological applications will create a second wave that will change the world . \" houston , he promises , will become the world ' s center of commodity trading , and he intends to be a part of it . in fact , he is already shopping for office space .\n\" this is the second wave , and enron ' s got it , \" he says , almost breathless . \" there are thousands of people running around the streets of houston that get it . \"\nenron fails to smooth things over\nby peter eavis\nsenior columnist\nthestreet . com\n10 / 23 / 2001 01 : 07 pm edt\nurl :\nenron ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) held a special conference call tuesday to address investor concerns that have weighed heavily on its stock .\nbut worries may persist after the energy trader offered few new details and the ceo publicly sparred with a gadfly investor over a shadowy off - balance sheet transaction .\nthe transaction that has drawn most attention in the past week is a complex financing that enron entered into with a partnership called ljm 2 , which was led by enron ' s finance chief andrew fastow . terminating this arrangement led to a $ 1 . 2 billion equity reduction in the third quarter . monday , enron stock plunged 20 % after the company said the securities and exchange commission is probing \" related party transactions . \" executives declined to respond to questions about fastow ' s role in the ljm 2 partnership on the tuesday call .\nanother key issue is the impact of the equity reduction . the company said on the call that its share count would decline by 60 million in the fourth quarter , due to the termination of the ljm 2 financing . but ceo ken lay said the company wouldn ' t be increasing its earnings guidance of $ 1 . 80 a share for 2001 and $ 2 . 15 for 2002 .\nwhen a share count drops , earnings per share should normally increase , assuming the earnings number stays constant . the 60 million shares are equivalent to about 6 . 5 % of the company ' s diluted total in the third quarter . as a result , enron should have raised its per - share profits forecast by about that much , assuming constant earnings .\nwhen asked on the call if earnings per share guidance would be increasing , ceo lay replied that the company had previously increased its guidance for this year . he then affirmed the 2002 number .\nnow , to be fair , enron may not be forecasting lower earnings . the planned reduction in shares may simply bring the total share count back close to a level in the fourth quarter and 2002 that analysts had originally expected . notably , the share count in the third quarter jumped by 20 million , meaning a fourth - quarter reduction might not change matters that much . alternatively , enron may beat fourth - quarter estimates by 6 . 5 % ; perhaps the company has simply chosen not to increase guidance at this stage , given uncertainties in the economy . in any case , more clarity on this matter is clearly needed .\ncalls to enron weren ' t immediately returned . the stock edged up 2 % tuesday after falling nearly 40 % since last week amid worries about complex off - balance sheet deals .\nthe call , arranged after enron ' s monday plunge , contained a lot of queries about two trusts , called marlin ii and whitewing , against which enron borrowed some $ 3 . 4 billion . lay became testy after questioning by richard grubman of boston - based hedge fund highfields capital management . grubman , who was called an \" a - - hole \" by enron ' s former ceo jeff skilling on an april conference call , was trying to find out the value of water assets held by marlin ii . the optimal way of paying back money borrowed through the trust is to sell the water assets .\ngrubman ' s line of questioning implied that the marlin assets were worth only about $ 100 million , meaning enron would have to find about $ 900 million to pay off the marlin ii - related debt . grubman arrived at $ 100 million after factoring in what he saw as the effects of a third - quarter writedown to water assets , some of which are included in marlin ii .\nlay disputed the $ 100 million number . at one point , he accused grubman of driving enron ' s stock down and monopolizing the tuesday conference call . in the middle of grubman ' s comments , lay told the call operator to go to the next caller .\ngrubman didn ' t immediately return a call seeking comment .\nif enron has to find $ 900 million , this can be done by issuing stock or raising cash on its balance sheet . if the latter route is taken , enron says it ' s likely to use asset sales to generate the cash . enron executives said liquidity would be sufficient and detailed at least $ 3 . 35 billion in available credit lines .\nbut if enron ' s debt - to - capital ratio exceeds 65 % , the covenants on some of those lines are broken . after the $ 1 . 2 billion equity writedown and other charges taken in the third quarter , that ratio is probably about 50 % - 55 % ( enron hasn ' t released a third - quarter balance sheet to arrive at an exact calculation ) . it would take $ 3 billion in further writedowns or charges to push enron ' s debt - to - capital ratio up to 65 % .\nstocks\nmore static for enron\nforbes . com staff , forbes . com\n10 . 23 . 01 , 11 : 15 am et\nnew york - enron scrambled again to reassure investors this morning , after it disclosed yesterday that the u . s . securities and exchange commission had asked for information on partnerships run by chief financial officer andrew fastow and other executives .\nenron ( nyse : ene ) last week reported a third - quarter loss of $ 638 million after taking $ 1 . 01 billion in charges on ill - fated investments . the market took that in stride until media reports parsed the earnings announcement and disclosed that $ 35 million of those losses were connected with the two limited partnerships run by fastow . enron shares , which plunged 23 % last week , nosedived another 21 % yesterday . enron bounced back slightly in morning trading .\nthe turmoil makes it clearer than ever that the energy trader ' s problems weren ' t solved by the recent departure of chief executive jeffrey skilling .\naes says indian state interfering in ops , complains to pm\n10 / 23 / 2001\ndow jones international news\n( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )\nnew delhi ( ap ) - - after enron corp . it is the turn of u . s . - based aes corp . to seek the indian prime minister ' s help to settle its grievances with a state government .\nin a letter to atal bihari vajpayee , aes corp .

' ' it has affected the price , ' ' she said , ' ' for everything related to heat and electrical power prices in the state . ' '\ncalifornia ' s complaint to the federal agency contends that el paso merchant ' ' has hoarded capacity and refused to attractively price unused capacity ' ' on the pipeline . the state also charges that el paso natural gas , the pipeline ' s owner , has had no incentive to spur competition , by offering discounts to other users , because the two companies are corporate siblings . the state said that el paso had violated federal natural gas statutes that prohibit anticompetitive behavior .\nthe sealed filings in the el paso case indicated that the company expected to make money by widening the ' ' basis spread ' ' - - the difference between what gas can be bought for in producing basins of texas and new mexico , at one end of the pipeline , and its price on delivery to southern california .\nas it turned out , spreads widened enormously over the last year as the price of gas soared in california , adding to costs for wholesale electricity that pushed the biggest utilities near bankruptcy . california utilities paid $ 6 . 2 billion above competitive prices for wholesale electricity over the last 10 months , state officials estimated . the utilities are not allowed to recoup the costs from customers . while the cost of 1 , 000 cubic feet of gas typically is less than $ 1 higher at the california end of the pipeline , spot prices in the state rose to almost $ 50 more than the texas - new mexico price in december .\nto executives of the parent company , the el paso corporation , the accusations of market manipulation are ludicrous .\nhigh gas prices in california , el paso executives said in interviews , are easily explained by soaring demand , the poor credit standing of the state ' s utilities and the failure of the utilities to retain pipeline capacity or store enough gas for winter .\n' ' the idea that anybody is holding back on california is really ridiculous , ' ' said clark c . smith , president of el paso merchant ' s operations in north america .\nsome el paso customers , though , agreed with california officials . the pacific gas this year , it is expected to have $ 700 million in north america alone . in its latest quarterly report , el paso attributed those profits , in part , to ' ' commodity market and trading margins ' ' that were enhanced by ' ' power price volatility , particularly in the western united states . ' '\ncritics contend that el paso set out to exploit those conditions . according to the sealed filings , on feb . 14 , 2000 , the day before el paso merchant was awarded the pipeline capacity , executives made a presentation to william a . wise , chief executive of the parent company , laying out the rationale for the bid .\nthe presentation outlined what it termed ' ' strategic advantages , ' ' including ' ' more control of total physical markets ' ' and the ' ' ability to influence the physical market to the benefit of any financial / hedge position , ' ' according to the sealed filings . the passages suggested that el paso expected the deal to give it sway over the market for trading actual volumes of gas and to support financial transactions it had entered into with other parties to limit its risk .\nfor every one - cent increase in the spread on gas prices , the presentation said , el paso merchant stood to make an additional $ 2 . 4 million .\nunder the heading ' ' challenges , ' ' according to the sealed filings , the presentation stated that storage was needed ' ' to help manipulate physical spreads , adding to the overall transport / storage cost . ' '\non april 14 , according to the sealed filings , el paso merchant ' s president at the time , greg g . jenkins , wrote a memorandum to mr . wise involving an update for directors meeting later that month . the memorandum stated : ' ' we will make money two ways : 1 ) increase the load factor , 2 ) widen the basis spread . ' '\nthe language appears to suggest that el paso merchant would profit by increasing the gas flow in the pipeline - - the load factor - - while increasing the difference between what gas could be bought for at one end and what it could be sold for at the other end - - the basis spread .\nin an interview , mr . smith , the el paso merchant executive , said that the unit ' s prices , and profits , on bulk gas sales in california were locked in months in advance , so that the company could not benefit from rising prices in the spot market .\notherwise , mr . smith declined to provide any details about money made on the pipeline deal or about financial terms of the transactions that locked in prices ahead of time . in addition , mr . smith said that nearly all of el paso merchant ' s pipeline capacity was used every day when prices spiked late last year , with no capacity withheld to increase prices .\nthe company did not respond last week to a request to discuss information in the sealed documents . but el paso merchant , in a filing with federal regulators , said california ' s complaint had ' ' misconstrued and incorrectly interpreted ' ' what it termed ' ' snippets of data . ' '\nabout this report\nthis article and others on california ' s energy problems are part of a joint effort with the pbs series ' ' frontline ' ' that will result in a documentary later this year .\nphoto : the el paso natural gas pipeline passes near topock , ariz . a dispute over bidding for its use has spurred a debate about oversight of the industry .
