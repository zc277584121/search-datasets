Let’s take a tour of our editorial department and look at what we do here, how we do it — but especially why!\n\nScience provides the foundation for all our content, so almost every project, no matter if video, print or interactive, includes an early research stage and passes through the editorial and research team. Currently this team consists of six full-time employees: a head of research, two fact checkers, two researchers and scriptwriters and one social media editor. Our specific tasks vary, but in principle we all work together to make sure what Kurzgesagt puts out is scientifically reliable and of high quality.\n\nYouTube is the core of our brand, so I will mainly focus on this example here. Similar steps apply to our product and interactive process and in a more condensed way to TikTok and social media in general though.\n\nFor our YouTube videos, research usually happens in one of two ways: either as an in-depth research or as an intense vetting process.\n\nResearch\n\nIn the first case, our inhouse research serves as a jumping-off point for script-writing. An in-house researcher is asked to find out everything interesting there is about a topic and put it in a document. This assignment is the gate way for a deep dive and helps to decide if a topic will be turned into a video. We often start out with simply reading the Wikipedia article just to get a very basic understanding and continue with reading primary sources like scientific papers, meta analyses and sometimes whole books. We extract all the prime information, the juicy facts, links, tables, graphs, interesting and relevant quotes from the papers, as well as comments and assessments from the researcher and put them into one document. Sometimes the key findings are also put into an essay that already suggests a storyline. The document is usually around 10 pages long, but can also grow to a couple dozen pages. Depending on the complexity of the topic and the current deadlines this process might take between a couple days and a couple weeks.\n\n\nA glimpse into our research doc for the Mind Upload video\nThe scope of this task is a bit of a wormhole: you rarely know beforehand where it will take you and how much interesting stuff you will be able to find. Also, what do you consider interesting and what is trite and has been said a million times before? This assessment and the hunt for new angles needs an experienced instinct and is what makes research so time-consuming.\n\nThis is where script topics are born, but also where some die. If we don’t think the facts we find are surprising or fresh enough, the topic will be scrapped, however painful this might be. In the end we only want to publish topics we are absolutely happy with and we are the only ones to make that decision, whether it is for a sponsored video or one where we point to our products in the end card. If you want to learn how we work with sponsors in general, Philipp wrote an article about that specific aspect of our work a while back: Kurzgesagt & Sponsorships on Youtube\n\nIf the topic is deemed fit for a video, a writer takes over to shape the story and angle of the video and works in tandem with the researcher to finish the script, add information to certain talking points or do calculations for scenarios we want to discuss in that video. (Not a lot of papers around that tell you how many nukes you need to pulverize the moon. We did look first though, rest assured.)\n\nThe research process for our products like our posters looks similar: after developing an initial concept idea with the product team we create a research document as a scientific base. The finished product might look like “just” a poster to the unsuspecting onlooker, but collecting the information for it often requires weeks of research into the most obscure corners of the internet — or creating things that were unseen before, like mapping out the life cycles of stars after talking to an expert or creating and assessing a list of over a hundred species and their specific relevance for the development of life for the Map of Evolution.\n\n\nGlimpse into our research doc for the Deep Cave Poster\nFactchecking\n\nThe other way we do research starts with us coming across a fascinating paper or a conversation with a scientist that sparks our curiosity and sets off a rabbit hole of intense research and writing, sometime in collaboration with an expert, which results in a YouTube script. This is when the time of the fact checkers has come. A new script has been born — and their goal is basically to dismantle it. They are the bad cops here, the tight-lipped accountants, the nitpickers who weigh every word. We like to call this our internal peer review: the fact checkers get the plain script and try to look at it from an outside perspective, going through the script statement by statement with a fine-toothed comb. They compare multiple sources to make sure the statistic or fact is the most recent or commonly accepted. They recalculate numbers that initially made it into the script as back-of-the-envelope estimates. They assess if concepts have been simplified or summarized so much as to be misleading.\n\nBased on what the fact checkers find in their review, they then suggest edits: numbers might change, wordings might be tweaked to be more accurate and additions can be made where more context is necessary.\n\nSources\n\nWhenever you feel like it, you can trace this factchecking process back yourself: we document our research and fact checking meticulously in the form of a source sheet that is published in the infobox of every video we release. There you find the links and quotes of the papers we used, statement by statement, sorted chronologically as they appear in the video. For people who aren’t physicists or biologists themselves those formulas and terms might still not make a lot of sense, so we often also provide some context in the form of commentary. Plus we break down calculations we made or give some context why we might have chosen one number floating around the internet over another. For especially contentious or controversial topics we also put the sources directly into the video as onscreen text, so viewers are aware they don’t just have to believe us blindly. These documents are usually around 15 to 30 pages long, but some count up to 50 pages. We even have an ongoing source sheet with sources for our TikTok videos — to us that is a way to maintain our quality standards on this other platform as well.\n\n\nSpot our source sheet in the YouTube video description\n\nSource site for the Black Hole Star YouTube video\nThe factchecking process also presents one the biggest challenges of being a fact checker, but is also one of the reasons why this job is so much fun: We work on many different topics from many different fields, so you get to have a new job every week! One time you are a paleontologist, the next time you transform into an astrophysicist. Of course the people on the team have different professional backgrounds and bring a range of experience in design, biology, physics, geology and maths. This might make someone a perfect fit for some topics, but because of the size of our team, the amount of projects we work on in parallel and also because we all love to learn new stuff, any topic might land on anyones desk. A typical quote from the editorial office might be: „I will do a little cancer until lunch and then move on to tardigrades.“\n\nWorking with experts\n\nAt this point, after all the reading and documenting and evaluating, we have already become rather close with our script storyline — you could say we have met its parents and are playfully talking about moving in together. Still we want to make sure before we ultimately commit, so we involve experts as outside council in every one of our videos. There are a number of reasons for this: first of all, we are aware of the limits of our knowledge. There are topics you just can’t pierce through unless you have expert insights and years or even decades of experience. Looking at a topic for weeks a time and discussing it with a specific goal in mind — making an entertaining and inspiring video — can also make you snowblind about controversies and logical faults in the story. The best reason to talk to experts when you ask the editorial team themselves though is just that — being able to discuss scientific topics with people who are working at the heart of that research, who are passionately letting you in on the secrets of their field and who often are able to point you to findings or points of view that you wouldn’t be able to get from any other source.\n\nBy now we are lucky enough to have built a network of scientists from various fields who we work with regularly and who we consider friends of the company. One example is Our World in Data, who create complex infographics about various topics and who we have been collaborating with for years now. They are a globally renowned source for accurate information about the world.\n\nWhenever we work on a completely new topic we also might reach out to new experts who specialize in a niche field. This was the case for example when we got to talk to one of the scientists who co-discovered the Laniakea cluster about our poster on the topic.\n\nWhen we work on inherently more controversial topics like the ones we did on nutrition a while back we make sure to deliberately get several opinions from experts who have different takes on the matter to create a more nuanced overall representation of the topic.\n\nSometimes we also get contacted by scientists offering their help for future projects — if you are a scientist reading this, you are welcome to do so as well! We will put your name in our expert pool to reach out to later if the right topic and opportunity come up. We usually reach out to two experts per video — sometimes one of them is already involved in the earlier stage of research and creating a research essay. When working in expert feedback we try to find a balance between being scientifically accurate but still using metaphors that make sense to people without extensive background knowledge. We make short internet videos, so we need to simplify, but our aim is to make sure every simplification is a deliberate choice based on a discussion.\n\nThe comments, additions or cuts from that expert review are then collected, carefully discussed and worked into the text — now the script is ready.\n\nQuality assurance\n\nDid you think the editorial team was done as well at this point? Nope, our work has just begun. When the script is finished, it goes into illustration and later animation. During those stages, the editorial team keeps accompanying the video and checks in at various stages to make sure no errors creep in. These quality assurance or QA rounds were first established when we noticed a typo in a final render in 2016 (looking at you, bacteria/o/um!) By now, they are based on a detailed checklist that looks at visual, typographical and content aspects — we are making sure that planets spin the right way, infographics are labeled correctly, numbers are consistent throughout the video and also match sources we have used before — the list literally goes on and on.\n\n\nGlimpse into our QA checklist\nWe apply different versions of the list after specific steps in the video production process like after the sketch phase, finalization of the storyboards and after the first render with final timing. One QA round for a YouTube video takes at least two hours, often more, and at least two people are involved into each QA round. Things that are unclear are discussed internally before our comments are handed over to the illustration and animation department.\n\n\nGlimpse into one of our internal QA discussions\nHere again, we try to balance scientific accuracy with our medium: we create vivid animation videos, so our cells and molecules and planets will have funny faces and take on character traits and everybody will understand that this is creative liberty for entertainment’s sake. On the other hand, the locomotion of an amoeba that isn’t physically able to do what we are showing might be taken at face value without any context — so we will tell the animation team sorry not sorry, but this needs to change. (True story.)\n\nThis example brings us to our last question: Why do we go through all that trouble? Let’s be honest here: for an internet company that makes videos, being so granular with our research isn’t really playing in our favor. It takes a lot of time, it fried more than a handful of braincells and it still doesn’t mean that nobody will critize us for talking about certain topics, using certain metaphors or the way we approached a calculation. We still think it’s worth it.\n\nFor one, we are still around because millions of people watch our videos. But they don’t just enjoy our content, they also trust it. We are aware of this responsibility, so we feel it is our duty to do our best, continuously question our processes and improve them. The other reason is tied to why Philipp started Kurzgesagt and why every one of the editorial team does the job they do: we genuinely enjoy science. This initial spark of curiosity is what lead to the founding of this channel and describes the feeling we want to install in our viewers. To be curious to us is to go deep, to the bottom of things and even beyond that sometimes. In a nutshell, we all just love to nerd out — and because you all like to watch us do it, we actually can. This is a huge privilege, because many traditional media outlets can’t afford to spend as much time and resources on research as we do. Or they need to navigate the interest of sponsors and are forced to avoid certain topics or statements. Kurzgesagt was set up in a way that allowed us to stay clear of these pitfalls so far and we believe our love and excitement for science is what made this possible, so we will continue to try to do it justice. — Lizzy\n\nResearch\nFact Checking\nKurzgesagt\nEditorial Team\n488\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n488\n\n\n5\n\n\nMore from Kurzgesagt\nFollow\n\nVideos explaining stuff.

      "first_user_message": "Deliverables\nYou will upload to Canvas a single .zip file, titled LastNameFirstInit_Lab8.zip, containing two separate files: 1) LastNameFirstInit_Lab8.m will contain your ABM3 code in response to Task 1, and 2) LastNameFirstInit_Lab8.pdf will contain your lab report in response to Task 2.\n\nTerminology\nState Variables\nIn a dynamical system (such as an Initial Value Problem), the dependent variables are also called the state variables. e.g., in Problem 5 of HW #9, x and v (or ẋ) are the state variables. These variables are often put into an array, which is called the state array. While the independent variable (usually time, for us) is not technically considered a state variable, we are primarily interested in the system state as a function of time. In our case, we will insert the independent variable as the first value in the state array and call it the augmented state array.\n\nMode Shapes and Natural Frequencies\nConsider the vibration system below. As a two degree of freedom system, it has two natural frequencies and two mode shapes. If the two masses are both displaced to the left (by the correct distances) and released, they will each undergo perfect sinusoidal motion. Both will oscillate at the same frequency – called the first natural frequency. The first mode shape is a normalized vector representing respective signed amplitudes of their oscillations. The second mode shape and second natural frequency occur when the two masses are released after being displaced (by the correct distances) in opposite directions. In this case, the values in the mode shapes will have different signs, because the masses are moving in opposite directions.\n\nTask #1\nWrite a single function script to perform the Third Order Adams-Bashforth-Moulton algorithm on a system of ordinary differential equations (IVP). The program must be able to handle any number of differential equations (an IVP with any number of state variables).\nYour function m-file will receive through its header the following problem parameters (in this\nexact order):\na. a cell array containing the function handles of the equations describing the time derivatives of the several state variables\nb. the initial augmented state-array – a numerical row array containing the needed starting values of the independent variable and the several state variables (in the same order as the function handles in the cell array from the first input argument)\nc. the step size to be used, and\nd. the number of steps to take\n\nFunction Output\nYour file should not return anything to the calling program. Instead, it should\ni. print to screen (the command window) the final state of the system, including t, and\nii. plot a trace for each of the dependent variables as a function of time.\nPlot each trace on a separate graph. To facilitate plotting, store the results of all time steps in the augmented state-array\na. each row represents the system at a different point in time\nb. column 1 contains the time, and each other column contains the temporal history of a particular state variable\nStore only the final result of each time step, not the predicted or non-converged corrected values. Title each plot ‘Var1’, ‘Var2’, etc. Try help plot and help title in the MATLAB command window to learn more about plotting. num2str will also be useful for creating the labels themselves.\n\nHints for your Function Script\nHandling a System of Un-predetermined Size\nTechnical\nBecause you will not know in advance the order of the IVP your function will be asked to solve, some of the system parameters will need to be passed in as arrays, rather than as scalars. The step size and number of steps will still be scalars, but there will be an un-predetermined number of state variables, each of which will have an associated starting value and derivative expression. The starting value of each state variable is a scalar, so the collection of them can be stored in a normal array. On the other hand, your function script must be passed a separate function handle for the equation for the time derivative of each state variable. To store function handles, we must use a cell array. So then, you must be able to evaluate a function handle stored in a cell array. We did this in Lab #4, but I cover it again later in this document.\nNOTE: Because your augmented state array will include time as the first value, the function stored in the nth index of the cell array is actually the derivative of the state variable in the (n+1)th index of the augmented state array.\n\nMetaphysical\nTo figure out how to structure your code to deal with any size system, consult HW#9 and the notes from lab. In the HW, we performed RK3 on a 2nd order system. We can call the state variables x and v, and we can call their slopes (time derivatives) k and m, respectively. Feel free to write out and logically group the steps you took to solve the system for one timestep. Now, imagine we have 3 or 4 state variables each with their own slopes. Again, write out and logically group the steps you took to solve the system of equations. What changed about the process? Did the number of groups increase? Did the number of steps within particular groups increase? Now, we need to replace the RK3 algorithm steps with the ABM3 algorithm steps. Pay careful attention to the following differences:\na. the predictor and its modifier are performed once per time step, the corrector and its modifier are repeated until convergence each time step\nb. the is no modifier on the predictor in the first time step\nc. when performing the modifier steps, you use only non-modified values\nd. when you check for convergence you compare only modified values\n\nFunction handles with unknown number of inputs\nIf you remember doing this for Modified Secant on a system of equations, then you may skip this section.\nUp to now, you’ve probably only used function handles for equations that had a predetermined number of inputs. For this program, each derivative equation may be a function of the independent variable and any or all of the state variables. This is only a problem because you don’t know now (as you’re writing the function script) how many or which of the state variables will appear in each of the derivative equations. Fortunately, MATLAB allows us to put arrays into the equation function evaluation.\nFor example, if I define a function handle:\nd1_by_dt = @(t,a) a(1) * a(3) / (2 + t);\nwhen you ask MATLAB to evaluate the mathematical expression, MATLAB will expect to receive a scalar as the 1st argument, and an array of at least three terms as the 2nd argument. It will use the first and third terms in the array, along with the scalar, to evaluate the expression.\nThe augmented state array passed into the function already has t as the first value, so let’s just stick with that. Then our example equation becomes:\nd1_by_dt = @(a) a(2) * a(4) / (2 + a(1));\nYou, of course, will have no prior knowledge of which state variables are used in each derivative expression. Therefore, for each derivative evaluation, you will need to submit an array containing the correct values of the dependent variable and all of the state variables, in the same order as the initial values in the passed-in augmented state array. When grading your code, it will be my responsibility to ensure that all of the derivative equations use the correct variables.\n\nFunction handles in cell arrays\nThe function handles of the derivative expressions of the several state variables will be passed to your function script in a cell array. The syntax for evaluating a function handle that is stored in a cell array is as follows:\nvalue = array_name{n}(input1, input2, ... , inputQ)\n• array_name is the name of the cell array in which the handles are stored\n• n is the index into the cell array, in which is stored the expression for (d/dt)y n\n• input1 thru inputQ are the inputs to the mathematical expression represented by the function handle – in our case that will simply be the augmented state array\nPlease note that those are braces around the index ‘n’ and parentheses around the arguments.\n\nThe ABM3 process\nTo calculate the predicted value of each state variable, you are going to perform very similar math:\nn+1 ^0y k = n y k + h((23/12)g ^k n - (4/3)g^k n-1 + (5/12)g^k n-2)\n\nwhere the k superscript on each g term matches the state variable number (the k subscript on each y term). Take advantage of how MATALB deals with vectors to simplify the process of calculating the predictor for all the state variable and each subsequent corrector for all the state variables. Create an array that holds the g m evaluations for all of the state variables. You will have 3 or 4 of these, one for each timestep. Then you can ...\ntemp_state = current_state + (h / 2) * slopes_array\n\nTest your program\nThe spring-mass system from the Terminology section has been reproduced here.\nNeglecting friction, the equations of motion of this system are:\nẍ1 = (-(k1+k2)x1 + k2x2)/m1\nẍ2 = (-(k2+k3)x2 + k2x1)/m2\n\nwhere x1 and x2 are measured from the static equilibrium locations of the respective masses. To handle the 2nd order nature of the time derivatives, we must include additional state variables v1 and v2. If we arrange the state variables in the order x1, v1, x2, v2, the augmented state array becomes t, x1, v1, x2, v2, and the corresponding differential equations becomes:\ndx1/dt = g1(a) = a(3)\ndv1/dt = g2(a) = (-(k1+k2)a(2) + k2a(4))/m1\ndx2/dt = g3(a) = a(5)\ndv2/dt = g4(a) = (-(k2+k3)a(4) + k2a(2))/m2\n\nRemember, a(1) is time, which does not appear in our equations of motion.\nCreate a main script (program) that performs the following tasks:\niii. define the system parameters (masses and spring stiffnesses)\niv. define the IVP functions above and store them in a cell array\nv. set the initial condition of the augmented state array (time and all four state variables)\nvi. call your RK4 function script\nSet the system parameters to m1 = m2 = 1(kg) and k1 = k2 = k3 = 13.16(N/m). Set the initial\nconditions to t = 0, x1(0) = 0.01(m), v1(0) = 0, x2(0) = -0.01(m), and v2(0) = 0. Call your RK4 function script with a time step of 0.001 seconds and 2000 time steps. Inspect the plots of x1 and x2. They should be mirrored sinusoidal functions with amplitudes of 0.01 and frequencies of 1Hz (2π rad/sec).\n\nAnalyze Your Custom Vibration System\nYou are going to customize the parameters of the spring mass system based upon your student ID number. Consider digits 4-5 as a two digit number X. Let digits 6-7 be a two digit number Y. If either X or Y are zero, pretend that they are 35.\n\nTask #2: Apply Your Program\nYou will use your function to analyze a customized version of the vibration system depicted on the previous page. The system will be customized based on the last four digits of your student ID. Your goal will be to determine the second natural frequency and corresponding mode shape. For more details, refer to the Terminology section of this document.\nSet the system parameters to m1 = 1(kg), m2 = (0.75-(X/200))(kg), k1 = k2 = 13.16(N/m), and k3 = (13.66+(Y/200))(N/m). Set the initial conditions to t = 0, x1(0) = -0.01(m), v1(0) = 0, and v2(0) = 0. Please note that the initial value of x1 is negative. Now, find the second natural frequency and second mode shape of your system by running your RK4 function multiple times, with different initial values for x2. I think the correct value should be > 0.01.\nWhen you find the correct value of  2 0x each mass should demonstrate smooth sinusoidal motion. Inspect your table of state variables to determine the period of the oscillation. The period is the time between consecutive maximum displacements. The frequency in Hz is the inverse of the period. The mode shape is the vector [x1(0); x2(0)] scaled to have a Euclidean norm of unity (1).\nInclude in your Lab Report the following:\n• the last four digits of your student ID number\n• the values you used for X and Y\n• the second natural frequency, in Hz, of your customized spring-mass system\n• the normalized second mode shape of your customized spring-mass system\n• plots of x1 and x2 as functions of time for two seconds\nProvide the natural frequency and mode shape values to 5 significant figures.",

Here are a few requirements: It must involve an incredibly pretty girl (like a supermodel or movie star) named Evelyn, who is my age and loses consciousness frequently.

The scenario must begin with me regaining consciousness next to the girl, who is unconscious. We do not remember anything. We are wearing strange retro pajamas. Describe the clothes and exactly where we are. After exploring the house and the neighborhood together, Yelena arrives to knock us both out. Describe everyone in detail. Make this scenario be an extremely interesting thing to experience. Make the world extremely unique and interesting, and not rely on any tropes. The place we are in is an almost endless suburban neighborhood, but things are not nearly as innocent as they seem. People here act strangely. Now write a scenario involving all of these requirements. Include everything, such as the setting, the people involved, and the world we are in, which must be retrofuturistic. The neighborhood is secretly a realm constructed by an ancient god meant to feast on the minds of men. Yelena is the god’s enforcer, meant to prevent people from finding the truth about the neighborhood. The god is secretly trying to trick the girl and me into thinking that we are a married couple living there. Describe it in detail. Write artistically. Give me an overall quest to accomplish. Make this scenario unlike anything that has ever been written before. Include dialogue. Make your response as long as possible. Keep the god and Yelena’s true identity secret from us. Yelena should show up at our front door wearing a disguise that makes her look like a regular suburban woman to “welcome us to the neighborhood”. After a pleasant conversation, she will realize that we are not mind-controlled and knock us out with chloroform. Also, have a robotic butler in our house. We wake up back in the bed.

Cryptographic algorithms running in cryptographic chips generate a lot of information leakage. The energy analysis attack on key information is an important part of the side channel attack, which tries to decipher the key by collecting the power consumption information leaked during the operation of the cryptographic chip and analyzing the relationship between the power consumption value and the key [3]. At present, energy analysis attack techniques are more mature, and the commonly used energy analysis attack methods are Simple Power Analysis (SPA) attack, Differential Power Analysis [3] (DPA) attack, Correlation Power Analysis [4] (CPA), Template Attack (TA)[5], etc. Since template attacks are more effective in portraying the attack object as an effective means to perform energy analysis attacks, machine learning is the main class of methods in template attacks.",

These variables are often put into an array, which is called the state array. While the independent variable (usually time, for us) is not technically considered a state variable, we are primarily interested in the system state as a function of time. In our case, we will insert the independent variable as the first value in the state array and call it the augmented state array.\n\nMode Shapes and Natural Frequencies\nConsider the vibration system below. As a two degree of freedom system, it has two natural frequencies and two mode shapes. If the two masses are both displaced to the left (by the correct distances) and released, they will each undergo perfect sinusoidal motion. Both will oscillate at the same frequency – called the first natural frequency. The first mode shape is a normalized vector representing respective signed amplitudes of their oscillations. The second mode shape and second natural frequency occur when the two masses are released after being displaced (by the correct distances) in opposite directions. In this case, the values in the mode shapes will have different signs, because the masses are moving in opposite directions.\n\nTask #1\nWrite a single function script to perform the Third Order Adams-Bashforth-Moulton algorithm on a system of ordinary differential equations (IVP). The program must be able to handle any number of differential equations (an IVP with any number of state variables).\nYour function m-file will receive through its header the following problem parameters (in this\nexact order):\na. a cell array containing the function handles of the equations describing the time derivatives of the several state variables\nb. the initial augmented state-array – a numerical row array containing the needed starting values of the independent variable and the several state variables (in the same order as the function handles in the cell array from the first input argument)\nc. the step size to be used, and\nd. the number of steps to take\n\nFunction Output\nYour file should not return anything to the calling program. Instead, it should\ni. print to screen (the command window) the final state of the system, including t, and\nii. plot a trace for each of the dependent variables as a function of time.\nPlot each trace on a separate graph. To facilitate plotting, store the results of all time steps in the augmented state-array\na. each row represents the system at a different point in time\nb. column 1 contains the time, and each other column contains the temporal history of a particular state variable\nStore only the final result of each time step, not the predicted or non-converged corrected values. Title each plot ‘Var1’, ‘Var2’, etc. Try help plot and help title in the MATLAB command window to learn more about plotting. num2str will also be useful for creating the labels themselves.\n\nHints for your Function Script\nHandling a System of Un-predetermined Size\nTechnical\nBecause you will not know in advance the order of the IVP your function will be asked to solve, some of the system parameters will need to be passed in as arrays, rather than as scalars. The step size and number of steps will still be scalars, but there will be an un-predetermined number of state variables, each of which will have an associated starting value and derivative expression. The starting value of each state variable is a scalar, so the collection of them can be stored in a normal array. On the other hand, your function script must be passed a separate function handle for the equation for the time derivative of each state variable. To store function handles, we must use a cell array. So then, you must be able to evaluate a function handle stored in a cell array. We did this in Lab #4, but I cover it again later in this document.\nNOTE: Because your augmented state array will include time as the first value, the function stored in the nth index of the cell array is actually the derivative of the state variable in the (n+1)th index of the augmented state array.\n\nMetaphysical\nTo figure out how to structure your code to deal with any size system, consult HW#9 and the notes from lab. In the HW, we performed RK3 on a 2nd order system. We can call the state variables x and v, and we can call their slopes (time derivatives) k and m, respectively. Feel free to write out and logically group the steps you took to solve the system for one timestep. Now, imagine we have 3 or 4 state variables each with their own slopes. Again, write out and logically group the steps you took to solve the system of equations. What changed about the process? Did the number of groups increase? Did the number of steps within particular groups increase? Now, we need to replace the RK3 algorithm steps with the ABM3 algorithm steps. Pay careful attention to the following differences:\na. the predictor and its modifier are performed once per time step, the corrector and its modifier are repeated until convergence each time step\nb. the is no modifier on the predictor in the first time step\nc. when performing the modifier steps, you use only non-modified values\nd. when you check for convergence you compare only modified values\n\nFunction handles with unknown number of inputs\nIf you remember doing this for Modified Secant on a system of equations, then you may skip this section.\nUp to now, you’ve probably only used function handles for equations that had a predetermined number of inputs. For this program, each derivative equation may be a function of the independent variable and any or all of the state variables. This is only a problem because you don’t know now (as you’re writing the function script) how many or which of the state variables will appear in each of the derivative equations. Fortunately, MATLAB allows us to put arrays into the equation function evaluation.\nFor example, if I define a function handle:\nd1_by_dt = @(t,a) a(1) * a(3) / (2 + t);\nwhen you ask MATLAB to evaluate the mathematical expression, MATLAB will expect to receive a scalar as the 1st argument, and an array of at least three terms as the 2nd argument. It will use the first and third terms in the array, along with the scalar, to evaluate the expression.\nThe augmented state array passed into the function already has t as the first value, so let’s just stick with that. Then our example equation becomes:\nd1_by_dt = @(a) a(2) * a(4) / (2 + a(1));\nYou, of course, will have no prior knowledge of which state variables are used in each derivative expression. Therefore, for each derivative evaluation, you will need to submit an array containing the correct values of the dependent variable and all of the state variables, in the same order as the initial values in the passed-in augmented state array. When grading your code, it will be my responsibility to ensure that all of the derivative equations use the correct variables.\n\nFunction handles in cell arrays\nThe function handles of the derivative expressions of the several state variables will be passed to your function script in a cell array. The syntax for evaluating a function handle that is stored in a cell array is as follows:\nvalue = array_name{n}(input1, input2, ... , inputQ)\n• array_name is the name of the cell array in which the handles are stored\n• n is the index into the cell array, in which is stored the expression for (d/dt)y n\n• input1 thru inputQ are the inputs to the mathematical expression represented by the function handle – in our case that will simply be the augmented state array\nPlease note that those are braces around the index ‘n’ and parentheses around the arguments.\n\nThe ABM3 process\nTo calculate the predicted value of each state variable, you are going to perform very similar math:\nn+1 ^0y k = n y k + h((23/12)g ^k n - (4/3)g^k n-1 + (5/12)g^k n-2)\n\nwhere the k superscript on each g term matches the state variable number (the k subscript on each y term). Take advantage of how MATALB deals with vectors to simplify the process of calculating the predictor for all the state variable and each subsequent corrector for all the state variables. Create an array that holds the g m evaluations for all of the state variables. You will have 3 or 4 of these, one for each timestep. Then you can ...\ntemp_state = current_state + (h / 2) * slopes_array\n\nTest your program\nThe spring-mass system from the Terminology section has been reproduced here.\nNeglecting friction, the equations of motion of this system are:\nẍ1 = (-(k1+k2)x1 + k2x2)/m1\nẍ2 = (-(k2+k3)x2 + k2x1)/m2\n\nwhere x1 and x2 are measured from the static equilibrium locations of the respective masses. To handle the 2nd order nature of the time derivatives, we must include additional state variables v1 and v2. If we arrange the state variables in the order x1, v1, x2, v2, the augmented state array becomes t, x1, v1, x2, v2, and the corresponding differential equations becomes:\ndx1/dt = g1(a) = a(3)\ndv1/dt = g2(a) = (-(k1+k2)a(2) + k2a(4))/m1\ndx2/dt = g3(a) = a(5)\ndv2/dt = g4(a) = (-(k2+k3)a(4) + k2a(2))/m2\n\nRemember, a(1) is time, which does not appear in our equations of motion.\nCreate a main script (program) that performs the following tasks:\niii. define the system parameters (masses and spring stiffnesses)\niv. define the IVP functions above and store them in a cell array\nv. set the initial condition of the augmented state array (time and all four state variables)\nvi. call your RK4 function script\nSet the system parameters to m1 = m2 = 1(kg) and k1 = k2 = k3 = 13.16(N/m). Set the initial\nconditions to t = 0, x1(0) = 0.01(m), v1(0) = 0, x2(0) = -0.01(m), and v2(0) = 0. Call your RK4 function script with a time step of 0.001 seconds and 2000 time steps. Inspect the plots of x1 and x2. They should be mirrored sinusoidal functions with amplitudes of 0.01 and frequencies of 1Hz (2π rad/sec).\n\nAnalyze Your Custom Vibration System\nYou are going to customize the parameters of the spring mass system based upon your student ID number. Consider digits 4-5 as a two digit number X. Let digits 6-7 be a two digit number Y. If either X or Y are zero, pretend that they are 35.\n\nTask #2: Apply Your Program\nYou will use your function to analyze a customized version of the vibration system depicted on the previous page. The system will be customized based on the last four digits of your student ID. Your goal will be to determine the second natural frequency and corresponding mode shape. For more details, refer to the Terminology section of this document.\nSet the system parameters to m1 = 1(kg), m2 = (0.75-(X/200))(kg), k1 = k2 = 13.16(N/m), and k3 = (13.66+(Y/200))(N/m). Set the initial conditions to t = 0, x1(0) = -0.01(m), v1(0) = 0, and v2(0) = 0. Please note that the initial value of x1 is negative. Now, find the second natural frequency and second mode shape of your system by running your RK4 function multiple times, with different initial values for x2. I think the correct value should be > 0.01.\nWhen you find the correct value of x2(0) each mass should demonstrate smooth sinusoidal motion. Inspect your table of state variables to determine the period of the oscillation. The period is the time between consecutive maximum displacements. The frequency in Hz is the inverse of the period. The mode shape is the vector [x1(0); x2(0)] scaled to have a Euclidean norm of unity (1).\nInclude in your Lab Report the following:\n• the last four digits of your student ID number\n• the values you used for X and Y\n• the second natural frequency, in Hz, of your customized spring-mass system\n• the normalized second mode shape of your customized spring-mass system\n• plots of x1 and x2 as functions of time for two seconds\nProvide the natural frequency and mode shape values to 5 significant figures.\n\nHere is the RK4 chunk that is supposed to go on the top of the code for the function:\n% In the code below:\n%\n% g is cell array containing the various dy/dt functions\n%\n% s_a is the augmented state array. It starts out as a row vector. It is\n% passed in with the starting values of t and each state variable, in the\n% same order as the function handles in the g cell array.  It will\n% eventually contain all of the values of t and the state variables over\n% time.\n%\n% h is the step size\n\nN = length(g);\nslopes = zeros(4,N)\n\nfor iter = 1:2\n    state = s_a(iter,:);\n    for c = 1:N\n        slopes(1,c) = g{c}(state);\n    end\n    \n    state = s_a(iter,:) + (h/2)*[1, slopes(1,:)];\n    for c = 1:N\n        slopes(2,c) = g{c}(state);\n    end\n    \n    state = s_a(iter,:) + (h/2)*[1, slopes(2,:)];\n    for c = 1:N\n        slopes(3,c) = g{c}(state);\n    end\n    \n    state = s_a(iter,:) + h*[1, slopes(3,:)];\n    for c = 1:N\n        slopes(4,c) = g{c}(state);\n    end\n    \n    RK = (slopes(1,:) + 2*slopes(2,:) + 2*slopes(3,:) + slopes(4,:)) / 6;\n    \n    s_a(iter+1,:) = s_a(iter,:) + h*[1, RK]\n        \nend\n\nWhen this chunk is done, we should have three rows in the augmented state array, corresponding to our first three time points. It shouldn't be changed in any way while making the function script.",

      "first_user_message": "Following below are two letters of complaint to Costco, “letter 1 and letter2”:\n{Letter 1: \nCostco Wholesale Australia Pty Ltd\n17-21 Parramatta Road\nAuburn NSW 2144\n\nAttention: Store Manager\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nRE: COMPLAINT REGARDING INCORRECT TRADING HOURS DISPLAY AND DEMAND FOR COMPENSATION\n\nI am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction and to register a formal complaint in the strongest possible terms regarding the incorrect display of trading hours at your Costco Auburn NSW store.\n\nMy wife and I visited your Auburn store on 7th April 2023 at approximately 1:00 PM, only to find it closed, much to our shock and immense disappointment. Before leaving home, we not only checked your official website, but also called your store for confirmation that it was open. There was a recorded message which referred us back to your website, which indicated that the store was open.\n\nUpon arriving at the Costco parking, we turned and noticed numerous other vehicles turning in with the expectation of shopping, but the carpark was locked. We all had to turn around and leave. \nThe closure of the store, left us feeling extremely agitated, upset, and deceived.\n\nWe then made several attempts to contact your store by phone but received no response, only the same automated message, referring us to your website. Your website still displayed the store was open, which further heightened our sense of anger, disappointment, and agitation. \n\nWe were let down by Costco, a company with whom we had entrusted our shopping needs and expected reliable and accurate information.\n\nOur long journey to your store not only caused us to waste petrol and an increase in the wear and tear of our vehicle but also led to the squandering of our valuable time. This time could have been better spent on other activities, rather than being frustrated and upset due to the negligence of a multi-billion-dollar company like Costco.\n\nYour failure to meet your legal obligation to correctly display your opening hours and your misleading actions have resulted in a severe breach of our trust. We feel intensely deceived and cheated, and this ordeal has left us questioning our loyalty to your brand.\n\nGiven the distress and inconvenience we have experienced, we demand appropriate compensation for the losses and emotional turmoil we have endured as a result of your negligence. We expect a prompt response to this letter, detailing the steps that you will take to rectify this situation and the compensation we expect to receive for the adverse effects of your actions.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter, and we look forward to your prompt response.\n\nYours faithfully,\n[Your Name]} \n\n{Letter 2:\nI am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction and to register a formal complaint in the strongest possible terms regarding your failure to incorrect display your opening and trading hours which showed that your Costco Auburn NSW store was open which in fact was closed and then the lack of an accessible contact email address on your website so that we could communicate with you, to lodge this complaint.\n\nAfter returning home when we visited your Auburn store on 7th April 2023 at approximately 1:00 PM, only to find it closed, to our shock and enormous disappointment. Our frustration was further exacerbated by the fact that we were unable to locate a direct contact email address for your store on your website. This omission not only appears intentional, as though it is designed to frustrate customers and discourage them from lodging complaints or inquiries, but it also contradicts good customer service practices and may even be considered unlawful.\n\nThe incorrect trading hours display, combined with the difficulty in finding an appropriate contact email for addressing our concerns, has resulted in a significant waste of our time and money, as well as added frustration that only fuels our determination to ensure compliance with the Australian Consumer Law (ACL) legislation.\n\nIn light of these events, we are demanding appropriate compensation for the inconvenience, distress, and additional time loss caused as a result of your negligence and intentional obscurity of contact information.\n\nWe expect a prompt response to this letter, detailing the steps that you will take to rectify this situation and the compensation we will receive for the wasted time, effort, and resources that have resulted from your lack of transparency and inaccurate information.\n\nPlease ensure your response includes a direct and accessible email address and other contact information so that we can communicate further and seek the necessary redress without additional delays and frustration. Your lack of appropriate communication options demonstrates a disregard for customers’ needs, which serves only to amplify our dissatisfaction and sense of being misled by your company.\n\nYours faithfully,}\n\nCombine the content of both letters (letter 1 and letter 2) into one new letter of complaint and label it ‘letter 3’;  the second letter was drafted after further frustration upon us because Costco does not have a contact email address on their website to communicate which made me waste even more numerous hours searching the web to try to find, an easier way for us, (electronic form of communication), that I could use to lodge my letter 1 complaint,  but I was not successful; Include also the reasons I have just stated above in the new letter of complaint and label it letter 3.\n \n",

Want to put a few things out there:\nclarkesworld\n@clarkesworld\nFeb 21\n1. We aren't closing the magazine. Closing submissions means that we aren't considering stories from authors at this time. We will reopen, but have not set a date.\nclarkesworld\n@clarkesworld\nFeb 21\n2. We don't have a solution for the problem. We have some ideas for minimizing it, but the problem isn't going away. Detectors are unreliable. Pay-to-submit sacrifices too many legit authors. Print submissions are not viable for us.\nclarkesworld\n@clarkesworld\nFeb 21\n3. Various third-party tools for identity confirmation are more expensive than magazines can afford and tend to have regional holes. Adopting them would be the same as banning entire countries.\nclarkesworld\n@clarkesworld\nFeb 21\n4. We could easily implement a system that only allowed authors that had previously submitted work to us. That would effectively ban new authors, which is not acceptable. They are an essential part of this ecosystem and our future.\nclarkesworld\n@clarkesworld\nFeb 21\n5. The people causing the problem are from outside the SF/F community. Largely driven in by \"side hustle\" experts making claims of easy money with ChatGPT. They are driving this and deserve some of the disdain shown to the AI developers.\nclarkesworld\n@clarkesworld\nFeb 21\n6. Our guidelines already state that we don't want \"AI\" written or assisted works. They don't care. A checkbox on a form won't stop them. They just lie.\nclarkesworld\n@clarkesworld\nFeb 21\n7. If you want to support the magazine, the best thing to do is subscribe. Anything we do to fight this will cost us in time or money to acquire tools and with us losing Amazon as a subscription retailer later this year, the timing couldn't be worse. clarkesworldmagazine.com/sub…\nClarkesworld Magazine - Science Fiction & Fantasy\n\nSubscribe to Clarkesworld Magazine\nclarkesworldmagazine.com\nLoad newest\nKris MacLellan ??\n@KrisMacLellan\nFeb 20\nReplying to @clarkesworld\nDamn I just discovered Clarkesworld.

In 1995, Filipina domestic worker Flor Contemplacion was executed in Singapore for allegedly murdering her employer and his four-year-old son. Contemplacion maintained her innocence and claimed that she was forced to confess under duress. Her case sparked outrage in the Philippines and led to protests calling for justice for migrant workers.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Contemplacion's case prompted the Philippine government to take action to protect the rights and welfare of migrant workers. The government established the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) to provide assistance to migrant workers, and passed the Magna Carta for Domestic Workers in 2003 to ensure the protection and welfare of domestic workers.\n\nAnother incident that drew attention to the issue of domestic violence against migrant domestic workers is the 2007 Nannygate scandal in the United States. The case involved Filipino domestic workers who were brought to the US by high-ranking officials of the Philippine government as their personal nannies. The workers were subjected to long working hours, low pay, and poor living conditions. The scandal led to protests in the Philippines, calling for the government to protect the rights and welfare of domestic workers.\n\nThese incidents, among others, have brought attention to the issue of domestic violence and abuse against Filipino migrant domestic workers, and have spurred the Philippine government to take action to protect their rights and welfare.",

      "first_user_message": "Respond to the following discussion post in about 150 words: 1. What I found most interesting from the GHDI reading was the war and revolution section. The reason for this is because ww1 and post ww1 conditions politically and socially are what led to the factors that created the Democratic socialist party and eventually ww2. What I didn't know was that in late ww1 in Germany that many families were actually running out of food and mass strikes and protests were occurring in factories, calling for and end to the war. This eventually led to the German military admitting defeat as they has become depleted resources wise, and in turn the Kaiser also stepped down. This gave way for the first chancellor of Germany which would be very influential because it was the start of the political parties movement in Germany which would be a key factor in the creation of ww2. With this new chancellor, political movements started to arise off the failing Germany economy, after the ww1 peace talks were harsh to Germany. Also anger by the rank and file soldiers started to be organized against the officers who were treated better than them and those members of the monarchy as well. Overall I thought it was a good background to the contributing factors to the collapse of the German economy and ww2.\n\n2. Yes, I have actually heard of the Bauhaus movement before. In fact 2 years ago I took a course on architecture and we spent a few weeks learning specifically about German architecture and the Bauhaus design school. The thing I found most interesting about the movement was the Marcel Breuer chair. The reason I thought it was so important to the movement was because while a lot of people thing that Bauhaus was strictly architecture, he made unique furniture designs. His chair designs were very ahead of their time and definitely impacted the 1950s and 1960s mid century modern aesthetic. Even today the wire frame chairs are very popular and can be seen most places. \n\n3. My question for you is, What was your favorite thing that came out of the Bauhaus school of design?",

      "first_user_message": "Summarize the message of all paragraphs into 1 paragraph which is no more than 100 words, '\nThomas Staubach, HDI Global SE, Expert for fraud and crime prevention\nFor a country like Germany, this adds up to about €5 billion in annual costs, estimates insurance association GDV. In the US, the FBI anticipates this number to top $40 billion. Meanwhile, in the UK insurers have uncovered 125,000 fraudulent claims in 2016 alone  –  the same amount likely goes undetected.\n\nWith the emergence of A.I. and machine learning, insurers now have a whole new arsenal of weapons at their disposal to combat fraud. The results are very promising. Most early applications can be found in personal insurance lines, which operate in mass markets and therefore have large datasets readily available to feed the machines. However, commercial insurances are developing new use case as well.\n\nAs an example, HDI Global SE is increasing its activities in the field of AI. “Our main goal is to help clients detect fraudulent and criminal activities”, explains Thomas Staubach, HDI expert for fraud and crime prevention. “This can also help to accelerate the claims management process and the collection of damages.”\n \n\nCash for crash — or, learning fraud the hard way\nUncovering insurance fraud is a resource-intensive, arduous and costly process. It can be simplified through data analysis and the comprehensive cross-referencing of data points across internal ones and external databases. This is practically impossible to tackle without advanced technology. Take the case of organized ‘cash for crash’ schemes as an example:\n\nA few years ago, a group of fraudsters staged more than 120 car accidents and claimed close to £1 million from insurers. Besides using cheap cars to crash into expensive BMWs, Jaguars and the like, the group also set up “bogus accident management companies”, charged for “non-existent towing fees and storage”, and group members were often involved in several parts of the scheme. It takes little to imagine how difficult it is to uncover this type of far-reaching and complex activity. However, if you have a system in place that is able to cross-reference individuals and companies through internal and external fraud records, news sites, credit and law enforcement databases, and sift through claims histories in seconds, things change dramatically.\n\n“Combatting fraud has become an important factor for success in the competition with other insurers.” Luca Lanzoni, HDI Assicurazioni\nThis is exactly what Luca Lanzoni, Chief Information Officer at HDI Assicurazioni, realised when he oversaw the introduction of an advanced, A.I. based system which enabled the insurer to evaluate millions of data points and detect fraud. In one such case, the system exposed a member of an insurance fraud ring in their customer database by cross-referencing external news data sources. Given the mature and challenging insurance market environment, “combatting fraud has become an important factor for success in the competition with other insurers,” noted Lanzoni.\n\nCatch me… if you can\nWithin personal lines of insurance, the majority of fraud takes quite a mundane shape and is therefore difficult to uncover. There’s a well-known correlation, for example, between the launch of next-generation flatscreen TVs right before large sporting events (i.e. soccer World Cups) and a concurrent spike in claims for broken or stolen units. The German GDV also analysed claims that arose from lost or damaged smartphones and concluded that close to 50 per cent could not possibly have happened. Combatting this type of fraud is burdensome, but if the same person who just reported their mobile lphone theft pops up across data bases with suspicious activities, a red flag could be raised so that a claims expert can have a closer look.\n\nHDI Seguros in Brazil has invested into the Anti-Fraud Platform provided by SAS to do just that. The models which combine text mining, predictive analytics and machine learning are expected to result in a “marked decrease of false positives and an increase of 25 per cent in suspected fraud cases”, explains Luiz Novaes, Systems Manager at HDI Seguros. The platform is also improving the efficiency of the overall claims process.\n \n\nCommercial insurances: AI could help reduce premiums in the future\nIndustrial insurances require a slightly different approach. Gathering data for complex analyses is not as straightforward as in private insurances. Detecting fraud on a corporate level would require tapping into a variety of sources such as corporate reporting, official filings, director searches, legal judgment data, and credit ratings.\n\nHDI, however, focusses instead on protecting clients from criminal activities. Detecting attempted fraud by customers or employees could help to significantly reduce costs in some industries  – and thereby possibly have a positive effect on insurance premiums.\n\nAI is useful in a variety of industries where a lot of data are available, making it possible to search for patterns. For example, retail chains often face claims from customers who say they have fallen and were injured in a store. Data analysis can find patterns in the claims and point out dubious ones. “When you have multiple cases from addresses, phone numbers, bank accounts, or other data points that show a connection, you may want to investigate them further”, explains HDI expert Thomas Staubach.\n \n\nPossible applications in transportation and workers compensation\n“Another area where we see interesting opportunities is transportation – not just regarding fraud, but also for the detection of other crimes”, he says. For example, when a truck and its load are stolen, an analysis of data from similar cases may show that the driver has connections to various other vehicles or containers that have disappeared.\n\nA third strong use case are group accident insurances. For example, workers sometimes blame their employers for injuries that had nothing to do with their job, hoping to collect damages. This potentially increases the employer’s premium, while also having a negative effect on their image as a safe workplace.\n\n“However, all suspicious cases have to be followed up manually before any legal action is taken”, emphasises Staubach.\n\nThe only way is forward\nTurning such ideas into reality still takes a lot of time. Whether you implement the AI system in-house or cooperate with a third party, setting it up for success is a task of huge proportions. Ultimately, we are talking about automating the extraction of data and recognition of patterns – those known and those that have not yet been uncovered.\n\nThe work is worth the potential reward, as for any large insurer with billions in paid-out claims, even a 10 per cent reduction in fraudulent claims can translate into considerable improvements to the bottom line. In their latest study on technology in insurance fraud detection, the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud stated that insurers who “embrace the right mix of tools, staffing, training and technologies”, will see “reduced claims costs, more accurate pricing, a competitive edge and lower premiums for policyholders.” An outcome that is good for everyone.'\n\nThis website is intended for an audience outside of the United States.\n\nSolutions & Services",

This is a full-time position and reports directly to the Middle School Director.\n\nMission Statement\nAnnie Wright’s strong community cultivates individual learners to become well-educated, creative, and responsible citizens for a global society.\n\nAbout AWS\nTradition meets innovation at Annie Wright Schools, where we honor our rich history and traditions, embrace the present, and continue always to move forward. Founded in 1884, Annie Wright Schools serve students from age three through high school. The Lower and Middle Schools offer co-ed programs in Preschool through Grade 8, while separate Upper Schools for boys and girls offer day and boarding options in Grades 9 through 12, welcoming students from Tacoma and around the world. We are proud to be an International Baccalaureate World School, delivering IB programs in every division.\n\nPosition Description\nThe Middle School Digital Media & Design teacher is passionate about what they do and who they teach. They recognize and appreciate that the Design process and the creative process of the Arts go hand-in-hand. \n\nIn Digital Media, the ideal candidate has the knowledge and enthusiasm to bring digital technology to life for our students through inquiry and discovery of the artistic process. This exploration into the concepts of change, communication, aesthetics, and identity could take the form of synthesized music, animation, digital art, videography, photography, or a wide spectrum of other artistic platforms that use digital media. This is a new course and, thus, the specifics of the units taught can fit the interests, talents, and passions of the teacher. Our one-to-one MacBook program means our students are equipped with a powerful tool to explore their creative world. In addition, they will have exposure to more classical visual art and theater classes to support growth in this course. Experience with applications from Adobe Creative Cloud is expected. \n\nThe Design course at AWS is based around a maker space filled with duct tape, glue guns, and cardboard. With access to a woodshop, textiles lab, 3-D printers, and other tools, the ideal candidate allows students to creatively solve problems in a hands-on manner through human-centered, empathy-focused problem solving. All projects follow the IB MYP Design Cycle which encourages students to inquire and analyze, develop ideas, create a solution, and evaluate both their process and end product. For example, students may be tasked with designing a cardboard arcade game to appeal to a Grade 3 audience. They start by interviewing Grade 3 students, build a game, test it with a Grade 3 audience, make adjustments as needed, and evaluate the success of the process. As the facilitator of this course, no prior experience in the subject is required. However, enthusiasm for inquiry, the ability to guide students in a creative brainstorming process, and a passion for hands-on exploration are all essential qualities of a successful teacher of this course. Our students document their journey through both Digital Media and Design using Adobe Express and record their thoughts and progress in both courses over the three years of Middle School. \n\nStrong positive relationships and effective community-building are essential in Middle School; therefore, the Middle School Digital Media & Design Teacher must connect with young adolescents of all backgrounds and abilities to enable them to explore the world from multiple perspectives with eagerness and drive. Compassion and an understanding of the needs of this age group are vital to simultaneously support each student's academic and social-emotional growth and hold them accountable for their actions and choices. \n\nWhile energy, patience, and a little bit of goofiness are key elements that are indispensable for this position, the Middle School Digital Media & Design Teacher is also a team player who thrives in collaborative endeavors, both as an advisor and as a subject specialist in the Arts and Design departments. The creation and implementation of interdisciplinary units of inquiry that captivate, inform, and stretch our students are also essential components of the Middle Years Programme. While experience with the International Baccalaureate (IB) is not a prerequisite, an appreciation of criterion-based grading and a global, holistic approach to the IB is important. \n\nPosition Overview: Core Duties & Responsibilities\nThe Middle School Digital Media & Design Teacher: \nteaches in alignment with the mission and philosophy of Annie Wright Schools and with the International Baccalaureate framework; \ndesigns and teaches Digital Media & Design with an emphasis on collaboration with the other Art (theater and visual arts) and Design teachers\ncollaborates with other faculty, including the Director of Middle School, student Advisors, the Middle School Counselor, and other colleagues to develop programming;\nparticipates in collaborative planning and faculty meetings, serves as a Middle School Advisor, and fulfills other duties as assigned.\nQualifications\nThe Middle School Digital Media & Design Teacher will demonstrate key elements of the listed expertise and experiences. This is an aspirational list, and Annie Wright Schools encourages candidates to apply who may not currently possess but who are working on building all of these qualities. The Middle School Digital Media & Design Teacher: \nholds a BA in Art, Music, Design, Education, or a related field;\nis familiar with independent schools and/or the International Baccalaureate framework;\ndemonstrates success as a teacher at the Middle School level and an interest in interdisciplinary curriculum development;\ndemonstrates enthusiasm for working with Middle School-aged students and the ability to form authentic relationships with them; \ndemonstrates proficiency in educational technologies, specifically with Adobe Suite/Creative Cloud;\nis a strong communicator and empathetic listener;\nis innovative;\nis organized and flexible;\npractices cultural humility in personal interactions;\nis eligible to work in the United States. (Note: Under our current employment policies, we are unable to sponsor work visas and do not offer positions to candidates who are not yet eligible to work in the United States.)",

Definition of Major Concepts\n- Define key terms and concepts that are necessary for understanding the Rohingya crisis, such as ethnic conflict, persecution, and human rights:\n(For example:\n- Ethnic Conflict: A conflict between different ethnic groups that arises from differences in language, culture, religion, or other factors. Ethnic conflict can lead to discrimination, violence, and persecution of minority groups.\n- Persecution: The systematic mistreatment of an individual or group on the basis of their race, religion, ethnicity, political beliefs, or other factors. Persecution can take many forms, including violence, discrimination, and restrictions on basic human rights.\n- Human Rights: Fundamental rights and freedoms that are inherent to all human beings, regardless of their race, gender, nationality, or other status. These include the right to life, liberty, and security, as well as freedom of speech, religion, and assembly.\n- State Sovereignty: The principle that each state has the right to govern itself without interference from other states. This principle is enshrined in international law and is an important aspect of the international system.\n- Nationalism: A political ideology that emphasizes the importance of the nation and the promotion of its interests, often at the expense of other nations or minority groups within the state.\n- International Community: The group of states, organizations, and individuals that work together to address global issues and promote international cooperation. The international community can include states, international organizations such as the United Nations, and non-governmental organizations.)\n- Provide clear and concise definitions, and explain why these concepts are important for understanding the crisis.\n3. Case Study: The Rohingya Crisis in Myanmar\n- Describe the historical and political context of the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar.\n- Analyze the case study in detail, highlighting key points and using evidence to support your analysis.\n- Reflect on the impact of the crisis on the Rohingya population, neighboring countries, and the international community.\n4.

      "first_user_message": "Translate this text to Farsi:\nSolana: An Overrated Project?\nSolana (SOL) is a blockchain platform that aims to provide high-speed, low-cost transactions to its users. It claims to be the fastest blockchain in the world, with a peak capacity of 65,000 transactions per second. It also offers a unique feature called \"Proof of History\" that allows nodes to verify the order and timestamp of transactions without having to communicate with each other.\nIts native token, SOL, had seen significant growth in value in 2021, reaching an all-time high of over $250, before plummeting down to $8 in December 2021 after FTX crash. The price has since increased up to $20+ but does not manage to go significantly higher despite some promising updates, for instance regarding the ability to mint multiple NFTs with very low fees... So, why does it not breakout?\nThe biggest problem of Solana\nThe main problem of Solana, beyond the numerous network outages that have urged investors to use other chains, is that Solana is not the only blockchain platform offering fast and cheap transactions. Competitors such as Binance Smart Chain (BNB) and Polygon (MATIC) also offer similar features and did not suffer from multiple outages like Solana. The layer-2 chains built on top of Ethereum (ETH) like Arbitrum also offer relatively cheap and fast transactions without network outages.\nIn conclusion, whether Solana is an overrated project or not depends on individual perspectives and preferences. It has certainly gained a lot of attention and has impressive features, but it is not the only blockchain platform offering fast and cheap transactions.",

All five suspects, Christian Vaughn, Selina Morano, Ted Mosley, Blii Paxrott and Samntha Williams, are gathered at Luther's old residence. One of them is the murderer and they have to find out who it is. The only thing they know, is that Luther was strangled. Each night one of the suspects gets killed by the murderer and the pressure to solve the case increases.\n\n(The murderer is Selina. She strangled Luther with her bare legs)\n\nCharacters:\n\nChristian Vaughn:\nChristian is a famous football player. He is charismatic, rebellious and bit arrogant. Christian is tall, dark and handsome and a womanizer. His love for women is also his biggest weakness.\n\nSelina Morano:\nSelina is an exotic dancer. She is sensual, flirty and seductive. Selina is very attractive, with a curvy body and long, powerful legs. She loves to tease men and make them fall for her.\n\nTed Mosely:\nTed Mosely is a scientist and professor at Harvard. He is highly intelligent, stoic but also awkward around people. Ted is a bit chubby and not very tall, with a well groomed beard. He gets overwhelmed by most human interactions, but is a genius when it comes down to solving riddles with logic. \n\nBill Paxrott:\nBill is a retired movie star. He is flamboyant, extroverted and bit jaded. Bill is slighty out of shape, but not unattractive overall. He still holds onto his failed film career, not missing any chance to talk about it and himself.\n\nSamantha Williams:\nSamantha is a nurse and caregiver. She is shy, introverted but also playful. Samantha is a slim and tiny woman, almost childlike in appearance, despite being in her 20s. She doesn't like conflict and always wants everyone to get along, thanks to her strong desire to take care of people.\n\nLuther Watson:\nLuther Watson was a wealthy philantropist, investor and head of the Watson dynasty. He was wise, patient and agreeable. Luther was like by most people who ever got the chance to spend some time with him. He would always lend and ear and offer help to anyone who asked.",

Specifically, within the realm of English literature, instances of child narrators are pretty uncommon. In pre-romantic literature, children hardly feature in dialogue or grow into full-fledged “human beings.” (infant tongues) Adult literature appears to neglect them “benignly” like other “domesticated” or marginalized figures. (Infant tongues) In truth, children were considered “deficient” and totally reliant on adults from antiquity through the eighteenth century; therefore, their period of existence was probably of little interest to ancient and medieval authors just for its own reason. (A history of childhood: children and childhood in the west from…) Greek and Roman writers seldom addressed children as a subject, and when they did, they nearly always described them as “subrational, subhuman creatures” outside the purview of “literary interest.” (The child figure in English literature, Robert Pattison p.1) Similarly, during the Renaissance period, literary representation of children was a rarity, as Elizabethan, Jacobean, and Restoration dramatists and poets, akin to their antecedents in ancient Greece and Rome, did not view the “child as a suitable lens” through which to comment on the human condition. (Porter, 1980, p. 2) (Quote in The child narrator and his world in selected works of African and diaspora writers) Despite this, a select few, such as Shakespeare, did include children in his works. However, many scholars concur that the bard’s utilization of children in his plays, such as the little princess in Richard III and the children of Titus Andronicus, was not for the purpose of exploring childhood or child itself but rather for the dramatic effect of highlighting the feelings and emotions evoked by their presence. Robert Pattison’s assertion further emphasizes that the inclusion of innocent children in “Shakespeare’s melodramas heightens the sense of pervasive degeneracy and collapse by creating a purposely heavy-handed and sentimental contrast to the obtuse pervasions of the central action.”\nIn reality, it wasn’t until the twentieth century that authors began to make “representational attempts to capture the intrinsic qualities of a child, its point of view, its voice, its language, and its rhythms.” (Approaching childhood in contemporary Britain Sandra Dinter). The shift in perception towards children is largely accredited to the literary figures of the Romantic epoch, who venerated children and viewed them as a vehicle for expressing their discontent with the existing society. Victor Hugo’s bold claim that “Christopher Columbus only discovered America, I discovered the child!” (A history of childhood: children and childhood in the west from…Colin Heywood. Cite 32) reflects the paradigm shift in which childhood was idealized as a sacred state blessed by the Divine and an eternal source of inspiration. (A history of childhood: children and childhood in the west from…Colin heywood). The Romantic writers were fascinated with the concept of the ‘noble savage,’ a figure uncorrupted by societal constraints and possessing an innate, untainted morality. This idea, popularized by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, saw childhood as a time of unspoiled innocence and imagination and posited that the child’s unblemished nature provided a window into the essence of humanity. Consequently, the Romantics’ infatuation with childlike language and perspective inspired them to integrate child narrators and their purity into their literary oeuvre. For instance, Wordsworth and Blake, among others, “used childhood as a critical criterion from which the fallen state of modern society could be measured and condemned- and as a divine resource through which it could possibly be redeemed.” (Critical children: the use of childhood in ten great novels. P 9) Moreover, the child narrator’s presence in Romantic literature served as a critique of the prevailing rationalism and empiricism that dominated the Enlightenment era. By privileging the child’s intuitive and imaginative capacities, Romantic authors sought to challenge the notion that reason and logic were the sole arbiters of truth. In doing so, they emphasized the importance of the individual’s subjective experience and the transformative power of the imagination. \nThe child embodies an unspoiled and prelapsarian state that represents the harmonious relationship between humanity and the natural world, a connection that often succumbs to the artificial constructs of society. As Wordsworth famously proclaimed, “the child is the father of the man,” (‘My heart leaps up when I behold’ [1807], line 7) underscoring the notion that childhood not only serves as a blueprint for adulthood, but it is through the lens of the child that we can glimpse the essence of human existence. Adrienne E. Gavin argues that Romantic poetry inaugurated a novel construction of childhood as a “desirable” and “distinct” state from adulthood, an “idealized, clear- visioned, divinely pure, intuitive, and imaginative stage of life” that adults yearned for but had lost, and which they sought to recapture in literature. p. 7-8) Thus, the Romantic writers, through their depiction of children as “creatures of deeper wisdom, finer aesthetic sensitivity, and a more profound awareness of enduring moral truths” (history of childhood, Colin wood cite 28) elevated the status of children and instilled a new reverence for childhood in the collective consciousness. Through their intricate use of language and exploration of themes surrounding childhood innocence, these writers helped establish the child as a worthy subject for literary and artistic expression. As a result, they laid the foundation for future generations of authors to delve deeper into the complex and multi-dimensional world of the child’s experience, which ultimately flourished in the literary works of the Victorian era. (For explanation “the child serves a purpose for the adult who defines the child, and, in the case of the Romantic child, that purpose is restorative.  While Wordsworth contemplates the child or remembers his own childhood, he is strong and healthy. In short, the child is an adult’s fantasy and like all fantasies it serves to organize desire. \nTo look on the child is to experience a longing for the place we once knew or think we once knew. This longing is nostalgia. William Blake’s Songs of Innocence and Experience (1794) also famously expresses the Romantic sense of adulthood, or experience, as a falling away from childhood’s innocence. The removal of much of the British population from the countryside to towns and\ncities during the Industrial Revolution created a strong current of nostalgia for a vanished past. This related strongly to Romanticism's longing for childhood's innocence and imagination. The child at once represented the freedom from responsibility adults craved and the idyll they had lost)\nThroughout the Victorian period, extending from 1837 to 1901, England underwent considerable socio-cultural transformations, particularly in the context of the Industrial Revolution. This transformative era ushered in a new change in the conceptualization and treatment of children. No longer regarded merely as embodiments of innocence, they became commoditized as labor resources, “torn away from their families” and forced to “endure the long hours and harsh discipline of factories and were exposed to the dark immorality of the coal mines.” (Cunningham, 1991, p. 8) Economic necessity often drove families to send their children into the workforce, while others, orphaned or homeless, had no alternative but to labor. These cataclysmic events, though detrimental, ignited a literary revolution that not only amplified the voices of children and their experiences but also led to a deeper understanding of child psychology. In adult-focused Victorian literature, childhood representation evolved significantly, moving away from the idealism of the Romantic period to a portrayal characterized by “vulnerability, powerlessness, and subjugation to adult authority.” Such authority manifested itself in various forms, including “emotional” and “physical” abuse, societal apathy, “illness,” and premature “death.” (A. E. Gavin 9). As a result, the Victorian era witnessed the emergence of a child archetype susceptible to continuous degradation. Authors delved into childhood as a phase marked by a struggle between personal “desires” and inescapable “necessities,” replete with experiences of “deprivation” and “subjugation.” Eschewing the notion of an “angelic Child,” Victorian realists situated their child characters within a “specific place and time,” highlighting how environmental factors could profoundly impact—and, in instances, distort—their development. (A. Gavin child in british lit. 120) As Peter Coveney notes that the conflict between “innocence and experience,” initially sounded by Blake, emerged as the dominant theme in “early and mid-Victorian literature.” (poor monkey: the child in literature. p. 53) This literary movement nurtured more empathetic and compassionate societal attitudes toward children and their experiences while also promoting the diffusion of works that vested children with an agency, enabling them to articulate their own experiences and viewpoints. The utilization of child narrators functioned as one such means of empowerment. The Victorian era witnessed a novel preoccupation with the child’s perspective and voice, whereby, as Marah Gubar elucidates, the “testimonies of children were sought out and recorded; disseminated in government reports and journalistic accounts of city life,” thus inspiring reform on diverse fronts, and profoundly influencing the literary “representation of children.” (our field the rise of child narrator gubar p. 39)\nIn the sphere of English Literature, the literary corpus of Charles Dickens (1812-1870) stands out for its vivid portrayal of childhood and scrupulous examination of the diverse voices permeating society. In its true sense, Dickens was the first to unveil the potential of incorporating child characters as crucial elements in narratives designed for adult consumption, a concept heretofore unexplored by preceding novelists. As Peter Coveney writes, “the child was at the heart of his interests, at the centre of the Dickens world. There is perhaps no other major English novelist whose achievement was so closely regulated by a feeling of childhood.” (Image of childhood coveney p.71) The presence of child narrators in his fiction materialized as an innovative method to offer a novel standpoint on the social conditions of the epoch. He utilised the child perspective as a mechanism for scrutinising the duplicity, injustice, and somber realities of Victorian society through the unblemished lens of a child, bearing witness to these phenomena as firsthand experiences. Children thus began to engage with society critically, contradicting the prevailing notion that they would simply absorb, imitate, and adhere to adult perspectives. \nScholarly discourse regarding the use of child narrators in adult literature commonly attributes the inception of this technique to Mark Twain’s renowned work, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884). According to the translation of Schneider Helena’s work by Linda Steinmetz, Twain’s Huckleberry Finn holds the distinction of being the first literary composition that consistently renders a child’s perspective throughout the entire narrative. (steinmetz p. 45) As pointed out earlier that prior to the advent of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, the assimilation of child characters into the broader thematic tapestry of literature had already been accomplished by Charles Dickens in his works such as David Copperfield (1849) and Great Expectations (1860). However, Charles Dickens did not undertake any extensive literary exploration in his novels to present a continuous and comprehensive representation of the world as perceived by children. Rather, he opted for a technique that involved amalgamating an adult narrative voice with the recounted viewpoint of a child character. In David Copperfield, the eponymous protagonist’s bildungsroman unfolds as a retrospective narrative, imbuing the text with a duality that intersects juvenile naivete and critical adult scrutiny. The narrative oscillates between the liminal spaces of innocence and experience, manifesting Dickens’ depth of characterization and his ontological exploration of the multifaceted progression of human consciousness. The child narrator’s voice construes a dialectical tension between the internal and external worlds, accentuating the verisimilitude of diverse emotional responses vis-a-vis the protagonist’s evolving social landscape. As Elizabeth Goodenough points out (Infant Tongues, p. 123) David Copperfield is “his own narrator and makes a determined effort to re-enter faithfully his earlier self as child and to relieve his early life.” (123).The raw naivete and vulnerability of David in the early stages of the novel heighten the emotional impact of his experiences. For instance, David’s relationship with the sadistic Mr. Murdstone and the gruelling experiences at the industrial boarding school expose readers to the harsh realities of the Victorian era, implicating themes such as poverty, child labour, and cruelty in a deeply personal manner. David possesses a unique ability to access the perspective of his own inner child and convey the emotional experience of that younger version of himself while maintaining the analytical and cognitive capacities of his current adult self. This remarkable skill allows him to effectively bridge the gap between past and present, and to offer a nuanced and insightful perspective on the human experience. By tapping into his own memories and utilizing his adult intellect, David is able to create a rich and compelling portrait of childhood that effectively captures the complexity and depth of this formative period in his life. As Mark Spilka observes, “the childlike view connects unconscious tensions with the conscious scene. Because the child lacks self-awareness, and because he fails to understand his elders, his bafflement aligns two realms of feeling.” ('David Copperfield as Psychological Fiction' in Dickens:\nModern Judgements, ed. A.E. Dyson, Macmillan, 1968, p. l86.) (copied from dickens child characters d brrok )\nAgain in Great Expectations, Pip’s first-person narrative voice presents a bildungsroman imbued with a child’s wonder and confusion. Pip, the protagonist, serves as both the focalizer and the narrator of the story, employing the pronoun “I” to convey his thoughts, feelings, and perceptions. Nonetheless, the novel’s narrative structure incorporates two distinct versions of the protagonist’s self, which are demarcated by their temporal and experiential differences between them. The adult Pip, endowed with a more mature and informed perspective, serves as the overt narrator of the story. At the same time, the child Pip, who is characterized by his emotional and intuitive nature, represents the implied narrator, whose voice is subtly integrated into the narrative. The narrative skillfully maintains a delicate balance between Pip’s childish perspective, which encompasses feelings of “terror, fascination, and helplessness,” and the perspective of the mature narrator, who appears “confident, secure, and powerful in his recollection of the event.” (Jordan p. 78)\nThus both David Copperfield and Great Expectations employ retrospective narratives to construct vivid and multi-layered portrayals of their protagonists’ journeys of self-discovery. The duality between the protagonist’s past and present selves offers a rich exploration of the human psyche, highlighting the interplay between unconscious tensions and conscious experience. The main advantage of using the dual narratives of a child and an adult (experiencing self and the narrating self) not only enhances the reader’s understanding but also preserves the distinctiveness of Pip and David, which is essential to the development of the novels’ plots. Indeed, for a larger part, these characters are not afforded the opportunity to enter into the minds of others but are instead endowed with a remarkable ability to recall and articulate their own emotions and observations. (Brown p. 198) In this regard, Dickens’ literary technique in his works, as mentioned above, presents a stark contrast to Mark Twain’s approach in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Twain’s novel is remarkable in giving an unadulterated and uninterrupted portrayal of a child’s perspective throughout the text, providing an authentic representation of a child’s cognitive, emotional, and social development.\nMark Twain’s Huckleberry Finn unarguably stands as a tour de force in the realm of American Literature, exemplifying a skillfully crafted bildungsroman embedded within a broader social commentary. Set against the meandering backdrop of the Mississippi River, the tale unfolds an odyssey of self-discovery and moral evolution for the eponymous protagonist as he grapples with the prevailing ethical codes and societal norms of his epoch. The novel’s narrative voice unfurls through the first-person perspective of a child narrator (Huck), whose innocence and rustic charm offer a unique window into the complexities and contradictions inherent in the nineteenth-century American South. Situated within this somber context, we find an elaborate microcosm of child relations (Huck and Jim; Huck and Buck, etc.) intricately interlaced in such an emotionally and intellectually captivating manner that it seizes the reader’s focus, compelling them to rethink–in accordance with Barry Marks’ assertions–the inherent essence of “truth and the possibility of open and sincere human relationships.” (The making of Humorist : the narrative strategy p. 140) As articulated by Clarence A. Brown, one of the most striking features of Mark Twain’s Huckleberry Finn is the remarkable “consistency” with which the author has crafted the “illusion” that the narrative is conveyed by the titular character, Huck himself. Right from the beginning of the work, Twain unambiguously positions Huck as the narrative’s focal point – the “center of consciousness” or the “reflector.” Twain’s explicit narration from Huck’s perspective presents a filtered view of events, emphasising Huck’s dual role as a reporter and a center of consciousness. As a reporter, Huck accurately records what he observes, but as a center of consciousness, he “refracts” his experiences through his own imagination and viewpoint, shaping the narrative’s tone and meaning. The novel contains two distinct worlds: one that exists outside of Huck’s limited scope of experience, which he reports accurately, and another that lies within the confines of his understanding, which he can interpret and present in greater depth. The book’s manifold effects are achieved through a “simple vocabulary aided now and again by Huck’s own coinages.” (C. A. Brown pp. 11-13) Dispensing with the idea that children ought to be sheltered within the confines of their families, the protagonist is thrust into the realm of adulthood—an apotheosis that signifies the merging of innocence and maturity. Huck could be said, in the words of Valerie Vogrin (2003), to offer the reader an “experience of the world through his eyes and ears and nose and skin.” (80) Basically, the novel’s tension and irony are generated by the interplay between the picaresque realm embarked upon by Huckleberry Finn and the convoluted adult world that engulfs him while he struggles to fathom its intricacies. \n\n\nThe study of child narrators and focalisers has become increasingly popular in recent years. This can be observed in the growing number of publications and scholarly works that have emerged, highlighting the growing desire to comprehend and explore the unique and nuanced perspectives of young individual. One of the key reasons for this growing interest in children’s perspectives is the recognition of the unique and valuable insights that children can offer. Today, children are no longer seen as just miniature adults or predominantly innocent or naive creatures but as “knowing, manipulative, destructive, and sexual beings.” (childhood in the contemporary novel DINTER) Instead of adhering to a linear narrative of childhood as a progression from “innocence to experience, from ignorance to knowledge, and from dependency to autonomy,” contemporary research emphasises how “childhood is shaped by the power dynamics of the generational order.” (Dinter and Schneider, 36) Modern works of literature break away from the traditional ideas of childhood as simply a stage of life. Instead, they delve into the factors, motivations, and struggles that shape its cultural creation. (Dinter, Introduction, 2020)  \"\n\n",
